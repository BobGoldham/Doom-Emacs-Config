* The Basics
** Confpkg
*** Disclaimer
This is an extremely useful snippet of configuration made by [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][tecosaur]],
and as such I have decided to /shamelessly steal it/.
All credit for the "Confpkg" system is with tecosaur.

*** Preparation

This approach is built around =#+call= invocations that affect the tangling.
Unfortunately for this use-case, babel call keywords are not executed on tangle.
Tangled noweb blocks /are/ however, and so we can fudge the behaviour we want by
tangling a noweb block to a temp file, with a noweb block that executes babel
calls in the buffer.

#+name: confpkg-prepare
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(condition-case nil
    (progn
      (message "Intitialising confpkg")
      <<bootstrap>>
      (org-fold-core-ignore-fragility-checks
        (org-babel-map-executables nil
          (when (eq (org-element-type (org-element-context)) 'babel-call)
            (org-babel-lob-execute-maybe)))))
  (quit (revert-buffer t t t)))
#+end_src

See the [[Bootstrap]] section for an explanation of the =<<bootstrap>>= noweb reference.

#+header: :tangle (expand-file-name (make-temp-name "emacs-org-babel-excuses/confpkg-prepare-") temporary-file-directory)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :mkdirp yes :export-embed no
<<confpkg-prepare()>>
#+end_src

*** Setup

Before generating the template with babel, we want to keep track of:
+ How many config groups are created
+ Information about each config group

To do this we can simply create two variables. Due to temp-buffer shenanigans,
we'll have to use global variables here.

Then we need to set up the two final phases of this process:
+ Creating =config.el=
+ Cleaning up the superfluous generated content

To trigger the final phases we'll add a hook to ~org-babel-post-tangle-hook~. Once
again, it would be preferred if this was done locally, but it needs to be
global. To avoid this causing headaches down the line we'll make sure when
implementing the hook function to have it remove itself from the hook when
executed.

#+name: confpkg-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent :noweb no-export
(setq confpkg--num 0
      confpkg--list nil)

<<confpkg-dependency-analysis>>
<<confpkg-strip-package-statements>>
<<confpkg-create-config>>
(defun confpkg-cleanup ()
  <<confpkg-cleanup>>
  )
<<confpkg-finaliser>>

<<confpkg-clear-old-files>>

(add-hook 'org-babel-tangle-finished-hook #'confpkg-tangle-finalise)
#+end_src

To avoid generating cruft, it would also be good to get rid of old tangled
config files at the start.

#+name: confpkg-clear-old-files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(make-directory "subconf" t)
(dolist (conf-file (directory-files "subconf" t "config-.*\\.el"))
  (delete-file conf-file))
#+end_src

Now to have this take effect, we can just use a babel call keyword. Thanks to
the preparation step this will be executed during tangling.

#+call: confpkg-setup[:results none]()

*** Package generation

Now we actually implement the =confpkg= babel function. We could just direct the
output into the =subconf/config-X.el= file without any extra steps, but why not be
a bit fancier and make it more like a package.

To do this, we'll have =confpkg= load a template and then fill it in using
~format-spec~. To make sure this is actually used, we'll call ~org-set-property~ to
modify the parent heading, and register the config group with the variables we
created earlier.

     `((?n . ,confpkg--num)
       (?p . ,confpkg-name)

       (?M . ,(format-time-string "%M"))
       (?S . ,(format-time-string "%S"))))))
#+end_src

Now all that's needed is a template to be used.

;;  Generated package (no.%n) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

<<%p>>

(provide '%p)
;;; %p.el ends here
#+end_src

This currently makes the included content look much more package-like that in
truly is. However, I hope that some static analysis in future will allow for
dependency information to be collected and included.

Lastly, should there be an issue or interruption, it's possible that the
modifications from =#+call: confpkg= may persist. If I've been good with my
committing, resolving this should be as simple as reverting unstaged changes.
So... back in reality, it would be nice to have a way to clean up =confpkg=
residue.

#+name: confpkg-cleanup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(org-fold-core-ignore-fragility-checks
  (org-babel-map-executables nil
    (when (and (eq (org-element-type (org-element-context)) 'babel-call)
               (equal (org-element-property :call (org-element-context)) "confpkg"))

      (org-entry-delete nil "header-args:emacs-lisp"))))
#+end_src

*** Identify cross-package dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :noweb-ref confpkg-dependency-analysis
:END:

At a basic level, we can search for regexp expressions indicating the definition
of functions or variables and search for their usage.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg--rough-extract-definitions (file)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let (symbols)
      (while (re-search-forward
              (rx line-start (* (any ?\s ?\t)) "("
                  (or "defun" "defmacro" "defsubst" "defgeneric" "defalias" "defvar" "defcustom" "defface" "deftheme"
                      "cl-defun" "cl-defmacro" "cl-defsubst" "cl-defmethod" "cl-defstruct" "cl-defgeneric" "cl-deftype")
                  (+ (any ?\s ?\t))
                  (group (+ (any "A-Z" "a-z" "0-9"
                                 ?+ ?- ?* ?/ ?_ ?~ ?! ?@ ?$ ?% ?^ ?& ?= ?: ?< ?> ?{ ?})))
                  (or blank ?\n))
              nil t)
        (push (match-string 1) symbols))
      symbols)))
#+end_src

Continuing our rough regexp approach, we can construct a similar function to
look for uses of symbols.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg--rough-uses-p (file symbols)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (let ((symbols (copy-sequence symbols)) uses-p)
      (while symbols
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (if (re-search-forward (rx word-start (literal (car symbols)) word-end) nil t)
            (setq uses-p t symbols nil)
          (setq symbols (cdr symbols))))
      uses-p)))
#+end_src

Now we can put these two functions together to annotate ~confpkg--list~ with their
(confpkg) dependencies.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-annotate-list-dependencies ()
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (plist-put confpkg :defines
               (confpkg--rough-extract-definitions
                (plist-get confpkg :file))))
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (let ((after (plist-get confpkg :after))
          requires)
      (dolist (other-confpkg confpkg--list)
        (when (and (not (eq other-confpkg confpkg))
                   (confpkg--rough-uses-p (plist-get confpkg :file)
                                          (plist-get other-confpkg :defines)))
          (push (plist-get other-confpkg :package) requires)))
      (when (and after (symbolp after))
        (push after requires))
      (plist-put confpkg :requires requires))))
#+end_src

Finally, we can use this information to edit the confpkg files to add the
necessary ~require~ statements.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-write-dependencies ()
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (when (plist-get confpkg :requires)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (setq buffer-file-name (plist-get confpkg :file))
        (insert-file-contents buffer-file-name)
        (re-search-forward "^;;; Code:\n")
        (insert "\n")
        (dolist (req (plist-get confpkg :requires))
          (insert (format "(require '%s)\n" req)))
        (write-region nil nil buffer-file-name)
        (set-buffer-modified-p nil)))))
#+end_src

*** Commenting out ~package!~ statements

It's easy enough to set ~package!~ statements to tangle to =packages.el=, however
with our noweb ref approach they will /also/ go to the config files. This could be
viewed as a problem, but I actually think it's rather nice to have the package
information with the config. So, we can look for an immediate ~package!~ statement
and simply comment it out. As a bonus, we can also then record which packages
are needed for each block of config.

#+name: confpkg-strip-package-statements
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-comment-out-package-statements ()
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (setq buffer-file-name (plist-get confpkg :file))
      (insert-file-contents buffer-file-name)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^;;; Code:\n[[:space:]\n]*(\\(package!\\|unpin!\\)[[:space:]\n]+\\([^[:space:]]+\\)\\b" nil t)
        (plist-put confpkg :package-statements
                   (nconc (plist-get confpkg :package-statements)
                          (list (match-string 2))))
        (let* ((start (progn (beginning-of-line) (point)))
               (end (progn (forward-sexp 1)
                           (if (looking-at "[\t ]*;.*")
                               (line-end-position)
                             (point))))
               (contents (buffer-substring start end))
               paste-start paste-end
               (comment-start ";")
               (comment-padding "   ")
               (comment-end ""))
          (delete-region start (1+ end))
          (re-search-backward "^;;; Code:")
          (beginning-of-line)
          (insert ";;  Package statement:\n")
          (setq paste-start (point))
          (insert contents)
          (setq paste-end (point))
          (insert  "\n;;\n")
          (comment-region paste-start paste-end 2)))
      (when (buffer-modified-p)
        (write-region nil nil buffer-file-name)
        (set-buffer-modified-p nil)))))
#+end_src

*** Creating the config file

After all the subconfig files have been tangled, we need to collect their
content and put them together into =config.el=. For this, all that's needed is a
function to go through the registered config groups and put their content in a
tempbuffer. We can call this with the finalising step.

#+name: confpkg-create-config

  (let ((revert-without-query '("config\\.el"))

Applying lexical binding to the config file is good for a number of reasons,
among which it's (slightly) faster than dynamic binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]] for
                                                             more info).

*** Quieter output

All the babel evaluation here ends up being quite noisy (along with a few other
                                                               things during tangle), let's see if we can change that.

*** Reporting load time information

#+call: confpkg("Confpkg timings")

When generating the config we added a form to collect load-time information.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar confpkg-load-time-tree (list (list 'root)))
(defvar confpkg-record-branch (list 'root))
(defvar confpkg-record-num 0)
#+end_src

It would be good to process ~confpkg-load-times~ at the end to make it more
useful, and provide a function to display load time information from it. This is
to aid in identification of confpkgs that take particularly long to load, and
thus would benefit from some attention.

To extract the per-confpkg load times, we can just take the difference in
~(float-time)~ and exclude the first entry.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-create-record (name elapsed &optional parent enclosing)
  (let ((parent (assoc (or parent (car confpkg-record-branch))
                       confpkg-load-time-tree))
        (record (cons name (list (list 'self
                                       :name (format "%s" name)
                                       :num (cl-incf confpkg-record-num)
                                       :elapsed elapsed
                                       :enclosing enclosing)))))
    (push record confpkg-load-time-tree)
    (push record (cdr parent))
    record))

(defun confpkg-start-record (name &optional parent)
  (let ((record (confpkg-create-record name 0.0e+NaN parent t)))
    (plist-put (cdadr record) :start (float-time))
    (push name confpkg-record-branch)
    record))

(defun confpkg-finish-record (name)
  (let ((self-record (cdar (last (cdr (assoc name confpkg-load-time-tree))))))
    (plist-put self-record :elapsed
               (- (float-time) (plist-get self-record :start) 0.0))
    (unless (equal (car confpkg-record-branch) name)
      (message "Warning: Confpkg timing record expected to finish %S, instead found %S. %S"
               name (car confpkg-record-branch) confpkg-record-branch))
    (setq confpkg-record-branch (cdr confpkg-record-branch))))
#+end_src

A convenience macro could be nice to have.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro confpkg-with-record (name &rest body)
  "Create a time record around BODY.
The record must have a NAME."
  (declare (indent 1))
  (let ((name-val (make-symbol "name-val"))
        (record-spec (make-symbol "record-spec")))
    `(let* ((,name-val ,name)
            (,record-spec (if (consp ,name-val) ,name-val (list ,name-val))))
       (apply #'confpkg-start-record ,record-spec)
       (unwind-protect
           (progn ,@body)
         (confpkg-finish-record (car ,record-spec))))))
#+end_src

It would also be nice to collect some other load-time-related information.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +require--log-timing-a (orig-fn feature &optional filename noerror)
  :around #'require
  (if (or (featurep feature)
          (eq feature 'cus-start) ; HACK Why!?!
          (assoc (format "require: %s" feature) confpkg-load-time-tree))
      (funcall orig-fn feature filename noerror)
    (confpkg-with-record (list (format "require: %s" feature)
                               (and (eq (car confpkg-record-branch) 'root)
                                    'requires))
      (funcall orig-fn feature filename noerror))))
#+end_src

At last, we'll go to some pains to make a nice result tabulation function.

I will readily admit that this function is absolutely horrible. I just spent an
evening adding to it till it worked then stopped touching it. Maybe in the
future I'll go back to it and try to clean up the implementation.

*** Finalise

At last, to clean up the content inserted by the babel calls we can just revert
the buffer. As long as ~org-babel-pre-tangle-hook~ hasn't been modified,
~save-buffer~ will be run at the start of the tangle process and so reverting will
take us back to just before the tangle started.

Since this is /the/ function added as the post-tangle hook, we also need to remove
the function from the hook and call the =config.el= creation function.

#+name: confpkg-finaliser
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

Within ~confpkg-tangle-finalise~ we carefully order each step so that
the most important steps go first, to minimise the impact should a particular
step fail.

                                                                                                                                                     noweb expansion bugfix]] which will be included in Org 9.5.4. This is
problematic if using Emacs 28.2 or older, so to get around this we must go
through a bootstrap process.

To start with, we'll check if we are:
+ Running an Org version prior to 9.5.4
+ Running in a ~noninteractive~ session
+ Using an Org that's not installed in the user directory
+ In a session with the symbol ~exit!~ defined

#+name: bootstrap
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(let ((required-org-version "9.5.4")
      (standard-output t))
  (when (and (version< (org-version) required-org-version)
             (not (string-match-p (regexp-quote (expand-file-name "~"))
                                  (locate-library "org"))))
    (cond
     ((and noninteractive (fboundp 'exit!))
      (print! (warn (format "Detected conditions provoking a config bootstrap (Org %s)" (org-version))))
      (print! (start "Initiating bootstrap..."))
      <<bootstrap-perform>>
      )
     (t (message "Installed Org version %s is too old, %s is needed.\nRun \"doom sync\" to fix."
                 (org-version) required-org-version)))))
#+end_src

If these conditions are met, we can assume that the loaded Org version is
insufficient, and that it's likely a Emacs is currently running a command like
=doom sync=, and so it makes sense to perform the 3-step bootstrap.
1. Temporarily rename =config.org= to =config.original.org=.
2. Create a new =config.org= that when tangled results in Org being installed.
3. Swap back to the original =config.org=, and re-sync.

#+name: bootstrap-perform
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(print! (item "Temporarily relocating config.org to config.original.org"))
(rename-file "config.org" "config.original.org" t)
<<boostrap-create-transient-config>>
(print! (item "%s") (bold "Re-running sync"))
(exit! :restart) ; Re-run =doom sync= with the transient config.
#+end_src

With the approach worked out, we just need to generate a snipped that will
create a new =config.org= that when tangled:
+ Tangles our Org recipe to =packages.el=
+ Swaps back to the original =config.org=
+ Re-runs =doom sync=

#+name: boostrap-create-transient-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(print! (item "Creating minimal init.el"))

(let ((standard-output #'ignore))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert
     ";;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-\n\n"
     (pp (quote
          <<bootstrap-init>>
          )))
    (write-region nil nil "init.el")))

(print! (item "Creating boostrap config.el"))

(let ((standard-output #'ignore))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert
     (org-element-interpret-data
      (list
       '(keyword (:key "title" :value "Boostrap Stage 1 Config" :post-blank 1))
       `(src-block
         (:language "emacs-lisp"
          :value ,(pp (quote (progn
                               <<boostrap-transition>>
                               )))
          :name "bootstrap-transition"
          :post-blank 1))
       `(src-block
         (:language "emacs-lisp"
          :parameters
          ,(concat ":noweb no-export "
                   ":tangle (expand-file-name (make-temp-name \"emacs-org-babel-excuses/confpkg-prepare-\") temporary-file-directory) "
                   ":mkdirp yes")
          :value ,(concat "<<" ; Split to avoid (prematurely) creating a noweb reference.
                          "bootstrap-transition()"
                          ">>\n"))))))
    (write-region nil nil "config.org")))
#+end_src

For the bootstrap we need a minimal =init.el=, just the literate module should be
sufficient.

#+name: bootstrap-init
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(doom! :config literate)
#+end_src

This =config.org= simply provides an entry point for us to run elisp during
tangle. We just need to make use of it to install Org and re-sync the original
configuration.

#+name: boostrap-transition
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(setq standard-output t)

(print! (start "Starting second stage of the bootstrap."))
(print! (item "Creating minimal packages.el"))

(let ((standard-output #'ignore))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert
     ";; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-\n\n"
     (pp (quote
          (package! org)
          )))
    (write-region nil nil "packages.el")))

(doom-packages-install)

(print! (item "Switching back to original config.org"))
(rename-file "config.original.org" "config.org" t)

(print! (item "%s") (bold "Re-running sync"))
(exit! :restart)
#+end_src

There we go, that should do the trick, so long as we call the =bootstrap= block at
the start of the tangle process. This is done by calling =bootstrap= within the
[[Preparation][confpkg preparation]] stage.

** Personal Information

#+call: confpkg()

It is useful to set the basics early on, since they will be used by lots of packages... I think?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Bob Goldham"
      user-mail-address "sold@sold.rip")
#+end_src

** Defaults

#+call: confpkg()

*** Basic Stuff
This is, again, largely inspired by [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][tecosaur]] and adjusted to fit my own needs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't

      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;;scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2                             ; It's nice to maintain a little margin
      native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors nil ; Don't interrupt me with nativecomp warnings
      sentence-end-double-space nil               ; In my world, sentences end with a single space
      display-time-default-load-average nil)      ; I don't think I've ever found this useful

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line
(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words

(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)                     ; Because why the heck would I use anything else?
(when (display-graphic-p)
  (setq x-select-request-type '(UTF8_STRING COMPOUND_TEXT TEXT STRING)))
#+end_src

When using a device with a battery, it would be nice to display battery
information. We can check for a battery during tangle via noweb, and only call
~display-battery-mode~ when relevant. From a look at the various status functions
in =battery.el=, it seems like the ~?L~ key is consistently =N/A= when there is no
battery, so we'll test on that.

#+name: battery-status-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none
(require 'battery)
(if (and battery-status-function
         (not (equal (alist-get ?L (funcall battery-status-function))
                     "N/A")))
    (prin1-to-string `(display-battery-mode 1))
  "")
#+end_src

Now with noweb we' use the result.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<battery-status-setup()>>
#+end_src

*** Backup file location

This is one of the things people usually want to change right away.
By default, Emacs saves backup files in the current directory.
These are the files ending in ~~~ that are cluttering up your directory
lists. The following code stashes them all in ~~/.config/emacs/backups~, where I
can find them with ~find-file~ if I really need to.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.config/emacs/backups")))
(with-eval-after-load 'tramp
(add-to-list 'tramp-backup-directory-alist
             (cons tramp-file-name-regexp nil)))
#+end_src

*** In-Emacs Customizations

When changes are made in an interface, they are added to ~init.el~ by default. I'd rather
have them in their own separate file. Conveniently, there exists a setting to do just that:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" doom-user-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src

*** Opening new frames

Rarely do I need to edit the same thing twice at once. (Makes sense, right?)
When opening a new frame, I would like to get to choose which buffer to open.

First, we need to enter the new frame immediately after splitting.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src
Then prompt for a buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src

*** Hippie expand

Completing text based on other avialable content is a great idea, an so ~dabbrev~
(dynamic abbreviations) are quite useful. There's another similar tool that
Emacs comes with though, called [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/text-expansion-hippie-expand][hippie expand]], which is just a bit nicer yet,
and can be used as a swap-in upgrade to ~dabbrev~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [remap dabbrev-expand] #'hippie-expand)
#+end_src

**** Expansion Prioritization

Hippie expand works by cycling through a series of expansion-generating
functions, listed in the variable ~hippie-expand-try-functions-list~.

By default, it completes (in order):
+ File names
+ Known abbreviations
+ Lists (i.e. bracketed regions)
+ Previous lines
+ Dabbrev (this buffer)
+ Dabbrev (all buffers)
+ Dabbrev (kill ring)
+ Known elisp symbols

I find that ~try-expand-line~ completions often appear when I actually want a
dabbrev completion, so let's deprioritise it somewhat. If I actually want to try
for a line expansion, it's fairly easy to deliberately trigger it --- just
invoke ~hippie-expand~ after typing a space and there will be no dabbrev
candidates.

Speaking of dabbrev, I do think of hippie-expand mostly as "a stangely named
dabbrev+", so let's prioritise the dabbrev-related expanders a bit. I'll also
toss in a nice non-default expansion generator as the first dabbrev candidate
function: ~try-expand-dabbrev-visible~.

There's another cool source of multi-word expansion (actually multi-line) that
isn't used by default, ~try-expand-dabbrev-from-kill~. I personally think this one
is quite neat, but don't want it to interfere with more common single-word
completions, and so will place it just above ~try-expand-line~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq hippie-expand-try-functions-list
      '(try-expand-list
        try-expand-dabbrev-visible
        try-expand-dabbrev
        try-expand-all-abbrevs
        try-expand-dabbrev-all-buffers
        try-complete-file-name-partially
        try-complete-file-name
        try-expand-dabbrev-from-kill
        try-expand-whole-kill
        try-expand-line
        try-complete-lisp-symbol-partially
        try-complete-lisp-symbol))
#+end_src

Unfortunately there's one aspect of ~try-expand-dabbrev-from-kill~ that I find
lets me down a bit, which is that it fails to complete when the killed text
starts with a newline and the current line does not. I'll see if I can do
something about this in the future.

**** Suffix stripping

I am occasionally annoyed by expansions that I make mid-line and cause a common
suffix in the completion to be repeated. For instance, say in an earlier line of
a file I have:

#+begin_example
func foo(int x, int y, int z)
#+end_example

where the =int y= argument has just been added. I move to another function that
should have the same adjustment and invoke hippie-expand (at ~|~) to save me keystrokes:

#+begin_example
func bar(int x,| int z)
#+end_example

This invokes ~try-expand-list~ and completes to

#+begin_example
func bar(int x, int y, int z) int z)
#+end_example

Clearly, that's not what I want! I suspect that we can make it "just work" the
vast majority of the time by looking to see if there's a suffix in the
completion that's also a prefix of the remainder of the line, and stripping it.
In our example, this would be =int z)= which would turn the completed line into:

#+begin_example
func bar(int x, int y, int z)
#+end_example

Hippie-expand doesn't provide a good point to modify expansion behaviour like
this, however the insertion of the expansion is handled by the helper function
~he-substitute-strings~, which we can advise to behave as we wish.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +he-subst-suffix-overlap (ins rem)
  "The longest suffix of the string INS that is a prefix of REM.
This is intended to be used when INS is a newly inserted string and REM is the
remainder of the line, to allow for handling potentially duplicated content."
  (let ((len (min (length ins) (length rem))))
    (while (and (> len 0)
                (not (eq 't (compare-strings ins (- len) nil rem 0 len))))
      (setq len (1- len)))
    len))

(defun +he-suffix-strip-a (args)
  "Filter ARG list for `he-substitute-string', truncating duplicated suffix.
ARGS is the raw argument list (STRING &optional TRANS-CASE)."
  (pcase-let* ((`(,ins &optional ,trans-case) args)
               (rem (save-excursion
                      (goto-char (marker-position he-string-end))
                      (buffer-substring-no-properties
                       (point) (line-end-position))))
               (ov (+he-subst-suffix-overlap ins rem)))
    (when (>= ov 0)
      (setq ins (substring ins 0 (- (length ins) ov))))
    (list ins trans-case)))

(advice-add #'he-substitute-string :filter-args #'+he-suffix-strip-a)
#+end_src

*** New Buffers

New buffers spawning in ~fundamental-mode~ is an objectively bad decision for 99% of use-cases.
I would much prefer using ~org-mode~ by default and inferring other modes by file extension.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src

** Doom Configuration

#+call: confpkg("Doom")

*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:

Doom is a wonderful framework that makes modular Emacs configs easy. To accomplish this, it uses /modules/.
Each module provides a list of packages to install and configurations to apply. Various flags can be used
to adjust these on a per-module-basis.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :noweb-ref none
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

#+end_src

**** General Structure

As is basically the default for complex Emacs configs, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration.
Doom supports this by default, which we can utilize through the ~literate~ module.

We also want to use (most of) Doom's default settings, including smartparens and bindings.

**** Just a text editor, please

You can do basically anything in Emacs.
Hell, you can run Emacs in Emacs and play Doom in Doom... I want none of that.
I use Emacs for editing text, notes and source-code, and little else.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
***** Setting fonts

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fantasque Sans Mono" :size 24)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Fantasque Sans Mono" :size 36)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 26)
      doom-symbol-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
      doom-emoji-font (font-spec :family "Twemoji")
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :size 22 :weight 'light))
#+end_src

***** Emojis
Emacs has an ~emoji~ script table. We're about to use it, but before doing
that we will excise some characters that I want rendered using the symbol font,
not as emojis.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(dolist (char '(?⏩ ?⏪ ?❓))
  (set-char-table-range char-script-table char 'symbol))
#+end_src

Except =doom-emoji-font= is not a "real" Doom variable.
So we'll just have to explicity enable it for emojis.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! 'after-setting-font-hook
  (defun +emoji-set-font ()
    (set-fontset-font t 'emoji doom-emoji-font nil 'prepend)))
#+end_src

We might as well also construct a regexp to make identifying emojis if buffers
more convenient.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +emoji-rx
  (let (emojis)
    (map-char-table
     (lambda (char set)
       (when (eq set 'emoji)
         (push (copy-tree char) emojis)))
     char-script-table)
    (rx-to-string `(any ,@emojis)))
  "A regexp to find all emoji-script characters.")
#+end_src

For the sake of convenient insertion, we'll also register some emoji aliases
based on common usage.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emoji-alternate-names
      '(("🙂" ":)")
        ("😄" ":D")
        ("😉" ";)")
        ("🙁" ":(")
        ("😆" "laughing face" "xD")
        ("🤣" "ROFL face")
        ("😢" ":'(")
        ("🥲" ":')")
        ("😮" ":o")
        ("😑" ":|")
        ("😎" "cool face")
        ("🤪" "goofy face")
        ("🤥" "pinnochio face" "liar face")
        ("😠" ">:(")
        ("😡" "angry+ face")
        ("🤬" "swearing face")
        ("🤢" "sick face")
        ("😈" "smiling imp")
        ("👿" "frowning imp")
        ("❤️" "<3")
        ("🫡" "o7")
        ("👍" "+1")
        ("👎" "-1")
        ("👈" "left")
        ("👉" "right")
        ("👆" "up")
        ("💯" "100")
        ("💸" "flying money")))
#+end_src

Lastly, when using Emacs 28+ it would be nice to open the nice emoji dispatch
with the leader key as well as =C-x 8 e=. Since =SPC e= is unclaimed, let's just use
that until we have a better use for it (we could also split up the insertion and
                                           querying commands in other parts of the map).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (>= emacs-major-version 29)
  (map! :leader
        (:prefix ("e" . "Emoji")
         :desc "Search" "s" #'emoji-search
         :desc "Recent" "r" #'emoji-recent
         :desc "List" "l" #'emoji-list
         :desc "Describe" "d" #'emoji-describe
         :desc "Insert" "i" #'emoji-insert
         :desc "Insert" "e" #'emoji-insert)))
#+end_src

***** Checking the system

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts. We can obtain a list of installed
fonts with either ~(font-family-list)~ or with the ~fc-list~ command.

#+name: detect-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none
(setq required-fonts '("Fantasque Sans ?Mono.*" "Overpass" "JuliaMono" "IBM Plex Mono"
                       "Merriweather" "Alegreya" "Twemoji"))

(setq available-fonts
      (delete-dups
       (or (font-family-list)
           (and (executable-find "fc-list")
                (with-temp-buffer
                  (call-process "fc-list" nil t nil ":" "family")
                  (split-string (buffer-string) "[,\n]"))))))

(setq missing-fonts
      (delq nil (mapcar
                 (lambda (font)
                   (unless (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (f)
                                               (string-match-p (format "^%s$" font) f))
                                             available-fonts))
                     font))
                 required-fonts)))
#+end_src

We can then use this to create a =doctor= check.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :noweb-ref doctor
(let (required-fonts available-fonts missing-fonts)
  <<detect-missing-fonts>>
  (if available-fonts
      (dolist (font missing-fonts)
        (warn! (format "Missing font: %s." font)))
    (warn! "Unable to check for missing fonts, is fc-list installed?")))
#+end_src

Furthermore, when fonts /are/ missing, it could be good to check the state of
affairs on startup.

#+name: warn-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref none
<<detect-missing-fonts>>

(if missing-fonts
    (pp-to-string
     `(unless noninteractive
        (add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook
          (run-at-time nil nil
                       (lambda ()
                         (let (required-fonts available-fonts missing-fonts)
                           <<detect-missing-fonts>>
                           (message "%s missing the following fonts: %s"
                                    (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))
                                    (mapconcat (lambda (font)
                                                 (propertize font 'face 'font-lock-variable-name-face))
                                               ',missing-fonts
                                               ", ")))
                         (sleep-for 0.5))))))
  ";; No missing fonts detected")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<warn-missing-fonts()>>
#+end_src

This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.

**** Opacity

I like having some window transparency, and with ~emacs-wayland~, this is natively
supported

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-frame-parameter nil 'alpha-background 80)
#+end_src

**** Theme

The default is ~doom-one~, so I will use ~doom-one~.
If the default changes, that's not my fault. I like this theme.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
#+end_src

With Doom installed, there is literally no good reason to want default themes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(delq! t custom-theme-load-path)
#+end_src

I have no idea what this does or how it works, I barely understand what a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition][race condition]] is,
but apparently it helps with those...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'window-setup-hook #'doom-init-theme-h)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'doom-init-theme-h 'append)
#+end_src

**** Line numbers
I love relative line numbers.
If you don't like them, you can set this to ~t~ instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

*** Helper macros

The following helper macros are added by Doom and should be used whenever possible:
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions

In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :noweb-ref none
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(defun doom-shut-up-a (orig-fn &rest args)
  (quiet! (apply orig-fn args)))

(advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around #'doom-shut-up-a)
#+end_src

*** Htmlize command

Another thing ripped right from tecosaur.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :noweb-ref none
(defcli! htmlize (file)
         "Export a FILE buffer to HTML."

         (print! "Htmlizing %s" file)

         (doom-initialize)
         (require 'highlight-numbers)
         (require 'highlight-quoted)
         (require 'rainbow-delimiters)
         (require 'engrave-faces-html)

         ;; Lighten org-mode
         (when (string= "org" (file-name-extension file))
           (setcdr (assoc 'org after-load-alist) nil)
           (setq org-load-hook nil)
           (require 'org)
           (setq org-mode-hook nil)
           (add-hook 'engrave-faces-before-hook
                     (lambda () (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
                                    (org-show-all)))))

         (engrave-faces-html-file file))
#+end_src

*** Org buffer creation

Let's make creating an Org buffer just that little bit easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(evil-define-command +evil-buffer-org-new (_count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)
        (setq-local doom-real-buffer-p t)))))

(map! :leader
      (:prefix "b"
       :desc "New empty Org buffer" "o" #'+evil-buffer-org-new))
#+end_src

** Other Things
*** Mouse Buttons

#+call: confpkg("Better jumper mouse")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src

*** Window Title

#+call: confpkg("Frame title")

The X/Wayland window title should just be the name of the currently active buffer and -
if applicable - project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote (or (bound-and-true-p org-roam-directory) "\u0000"))
                             (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?\s buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (when-let ((project-name (and (featurep 'projectile) (projectile-project-name))))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org 
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org  doom=.

*** Grabbing source block content as a string

In a few places in this configuration, it is desirable to grab a source block's
content as a string. We can use a noweb =<<replacement>>= form, however that
doesn't work with string escaping.

We can get around this by using noweb execution and write an name (unexported)
babel block that will grab the content of another named source block as a
string. Note that this does not currently expand nested noweb references.

#+name: grab
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var name="" pre="" post="" :noweb-ref none
;; Babel block: grab(name &optional pre post)
;; NAME is the name of the source block to grab.
;; PRE is a string to prepend to the content of the block.
;; POST is a string to append to the content of the block.
(if-let ((block-pos (org-babel-find-named-block name))
         (block (org-element-at-point block-pos)))
    (format "%S" (concat pre (string-trim (org-element-property :value block)) post))
  ;; look for :noweb-ref matches
  (let (block-contents)
    (org-element-cache-map
     (lambda (src)
       (when (and (not (org-in-commented-heading-p nil src))
                  (not (org-in-archived-heading-p nil src))
                  (let* ((lang (org-element-property :language src))
                         (params
                          (apply
                           #'org-babel-merge-params
                           (append
                            (org-with-point-at (org-element-property :begin src)
                              (org-babel-params-from-properties lang t))
                            (mapcar
                             (lambda (h)
                               (org-babel-parse-header-arguments h t))
                             (cons (org-element-property :parameters src)
                                   (org-element-property :header src))))))
                         (ref (alist-get :noweb-ref params)))
                    (equal ref name)))
         (push (org-babel--normalize-body src)
               block-contents)))
     :granularity 'element
     :restrict-elements '(src-block))
    (and block-contents
         (format "%S"
                 (concat
                  pre
                  (mapconcat
                   #'identity
                   (nreverse block-contents)
                   "\n\n")
                  post)))))
#+end_src

There we go, that's all it takes! This can be used via the form =<<grab("block-name")>>=.

* Packages

The heart of any Emacs config and the reason why we did all the other bits leading up to this.
Packages are what takes a barely comprehensible LISP-Interpreter like Emacs and makes it a
multifunctional, highly versatile editor/IDE.

** Loading Packages
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:

The way we load said packages is via the ~package!~ macro in =packages.el=.
This file should *never* be byte-compiled, since it would no longer be properly reinterpreted upon ~doom sync~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el" :comments no
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-

** Convenience
*** Which-key

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg which-key")

This helpful popup explaining keybinds is nice.
I want to see it immediately.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.25)
#+end_src

+I also think+ /tecosaur thought/ that having =evil-= appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let's change that, and do a few other similar tweaks while we're at it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))
#+end_src

** Tools
*** Abbrev

#+call: confpkg()

Abbrev mode is great, and something I make use of everywhere.
As such, I want it on by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default abbrev-mode t)
#+end_src

Abbrev-mode can save and load abbreviations from an "abbref file", which I'd
like to locate in my Doom config folder.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq abbrev-file-name (expand-file-name "abbrev.el" doom-user-dir))
#+end_src

I need to figure out how to manage abbrev changes per-session,
but for now I'm going to be overly cautious and avoid saving
any modifications to the global abbref file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq save-abbrevs nil)
#+end_src

*** EVIL

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg evil")

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not
--- so let's make that the default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

I don't use ~evil-escape-mode~, so I may as well turn it off, I've heard it
contributes a typing delay. I'm not sure it's much, but it is an extra
~pre-command-hook~ that I don't benefit from, so...
It seems that there's a dedicated package for this, so instead of just disabling
the mode on startup, let's prevent installation of the package.

~evil-escape-mode~ is simply weird. I don't use it, I don't think anyone does.
It also --- apparently --- adds lag to every instance of command execution or
/typing a letter/, which is a pretty big no-no in my opinion.

Out it goes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el :noweb-ref none
(package! evil-escape :disable t)

*** Headlice

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Headlice")

Dealing with licenses and in particular license headers is frankly a bit of a
pain, and so I've written a package so that this just takes care of itself and I
don't have to think about it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! headlice :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/headlice"
                            :files (:defaults "licenses" "headers")))
#+end_src

The author of this package has set some pretty good defaults, but as usual there
are some specific personal preferences I'd like to apply, and then there's the
minor matter of hooking it into Emacs/Doom.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! headlice
  :hook (prog-mode . headlice-auto-insert)
  :config
  (setq headlice-preferred-license 'mpl
        headlice-use-spdx-headers t
        headlice-ignored-licenses '(gpl-3)
        headlice-user-email "sold@sold.rip")
  (defalias '+file-templates/insert-license #'headlice-create-license))
#+end_src

*** Magit

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Magit")

Magit is a wonderful tool, but we can do better than the default config.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
<<magit-toplevel>>
(after! magit
  <<magit-tweaks>>)
#+end_src

**** Easier Default Remotes
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :noweb-ref magit-tweaks
:END:

When creating a new project, I often want the remote to be to my personal github
account. Let's make that a bit more streamlined by introducing a quick-entry
"default forge" option.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

While we're at it, when creating a remote with the same name as my github
username in a project where an https github remote already exists, let's make
the pre-filled remote url use ssh.

**** Magit Delta

[[https://github.com/dandavison/delta/][Delta]] is a git diff syntax highlighter written in rust. The author also wrote a
package to hook this into the magit diff view (which don't get any syntax
highlighting by default). This requires the ~delta~ binary. It's packaged on some
distributions, but most reliably installed through Rust's package manager cargo.

Now we can make use of the package for this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el :noweb-ref none
(package! magit-delta :recipe (:host github :repo "dandavison/magit-delta"))
#+end_src

All that's left is to hook it into magit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none
(magit-delta-mode +1)
#+end_src

*** MPRIS

It's nice to be able to interact with MPRIS players. This would just be a
dependency of =org-music= or =doom-modeline-media-player=, but I haven't made it
available on any an elisp archives. Thankfully most Emacs package managers make
using Git repository URLs pretty easy these days.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

*** Corfu

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Corfu", after="corfu")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Jinx

#+call: confpkg()

Minad's Jinx spell-checker looks pretty nifty. When Henrik and I (or someone
else) have some more bandwidth, I think it would be good to incorporate with
Doom.

In the meantime, let's use it here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el :noweb-ref none
(package! jinx)
#+end_src

**** Configuration

Jinx has some pretty lovely defaults out of the box, we'll just be making a few
tweaks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! jinx
  :defer t
  :init
  (add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'global-jinx-mode)
  :config
  ;; Use my custom dictionary
  (setq jinx-languages "en-custom")
  ;; Extra face(s) to ignore
  (push 'org-inline-src-block

  ;; Take over the relevant bindings.

    (global-set-key [remap evil-prev-flyspell-error] #'jinx-previous))
  ;; I prefer for `point' to end up at the start of the word,
  ;; not just after the end.
  (advice-add 'jinx-next :after (lambda (_) (left-word))))
#+end_src

**** Autocorrect

#+call: confpkg()

I used to have a small collection of configuration here, but then it grew
larger, and now it's a package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! autocorrect :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/autocorrect"))
#+end_src

To integrate Jinx with the =autocorrect= package, we need to tell it:
+ About corrections made with Jinx
+ How to tell if a word is spelled correctly with Jinx
+ When it's appropriate to make an autocorrection

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! autocorrect
  :after jinx

    "Check if WORD is valid."
    ;; Mostly a copy of `jinx--word-valid-p', just without the buffer substring.
    ;; It would have been nice if `jinx--word-valid-p' implemented like this

    (or (member word jinx--session-words)
        ;; Allow capitalized words
        (and (string-match-p "\\`[[:upper:]][[:lower:]]+\\'" word)
             (cl-loop

              thereis (and (string-equal-ignore-case word w)
                           (string-match-p "\\`[[:lower:]]+\\'" w))))
        (cl-loop for dict in jinx--dicts
                 thereis (jinx--mod-check dict word))))

  (defun autocorrect-jinx-appropriate (pos)
    "Return non-nil if it is appropriate to spellcheck at POS according to jinx."
    (and (not (jinx--face-ignored-p pos))

#+end_src

*** TRAMP

#+call: confpkg("TRAMP")

Another lovely Emacs feature, TRAMP stands for /Transparent Remote Access,
Multiple Protocol/. In brief, it's a lovely way to wander around outside your
local filesystem.

**** Prompt recognition

Unfortunately, when connecting to remote machines Tramp can be a wee pit picky
with the prompt format. Let's try to get Bash, and be a bit more permissive with
prompt recognition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp
  (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/bash")
  (setq tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "\\(?:^\\|\n\\|\x0d\\)[^]#$%>\n]*#?[]#$%>] *\\(\e\\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z] *\\)*")) ;; default + 
#+end_src

*** Auto activating snippets

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg AAS")

Sometimes pressing =TAB= is just too much.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** YASnippet

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg YASnippet")

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nested snippets are good, so let's enable that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** String inflection

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg String Inflection")

For when you want to change the case pattern for a symbol.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! string-inflection :pin "617df25e91351feffe6aff4d9e4724733449d608")

*** Smart Parentheses

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg SmartParens")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(sp-local-pair
 '(org-mode)
 "<<" ">>"
 :actions '(insert))
#+end_src

** Visuals

Why is this not in the other Visuals block?
Because this is installing new packages and thus needs to be tangled appropriately.

*** Info Colours

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Info colors")

This makes manual pages nicer to look at by adding variable pitch fontification
and colouring 🙂.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! info-colors)
#+end_src

To use this we'll just hook it into =Info=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  :commands (info-colors-fontify-node))

(add-hook 'Info-selection-hook 'info-colors-fontify-node)

*** Modus Themes

These are in Emacs28 by default, but updates come in frequently and I'd like to keep up.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

#+end_src

*** Spacemacs Themes

Because why not?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! spacemacs-theme)
#+end_src

*** Doom modeline

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Doom modeline", after="doom-modeline")

**** Media player

We can put current MPRIS player information into the moeline
with the media player package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! doom-modeline-media-player
  :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/doom-modeline-media-player"))
#+end_src

To enable the lazy loading, we make =doom-modeline= aware of the segment function
in ~:init~, and the segment function itself is autoloaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! doom-modeline-media-player
  :defer t
  :init
  (after! doom-modeline
    (add-to-list 'doom-modeline-fn-alist
                 (const 'media-player #'doom-modeline-segment--media-player)))
  :config
  (defun +single-fullscreen-window-p ()
    (and (memq (frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen) '(fullscreen fullboth))
         (not (consp (car (window-tree))))))
  (setq doom-modeline-media-player #'+single-fullscreen-window-p
        doom-modeline-media-player-playback-indication 'dim))
#+end_src

**** PDF modeline

I think the PDF modeline could do with tweaking. I raised [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/pull/425][an issue]] on this,
however the response was basically "put your preferences in your personal
config, the current default is sensible" --- so here we are.

First up I'm going to want a segment for just the buffer file name, and a PDF
icon. Then we'll redefine two functions used to generate the modeline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(doom-modeline-def-segment buffer-name
  "Display the current buffer's name, without any other information."
  (concat
   (doom-modeline-spc)
   (doom-modeline--buffer-name)))

(doom-modeline-def-segment pdf-icon
  "PDF icon from nerd-icons."

*** Mixed pitch

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg mixed pitch")

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui zen= module.
#+end_quote

We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialisation, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialisation and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default (see the
subsequent face definition). This was created for writeroom mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(setq! variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 27))

(after! mixed-pitch
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Now, as Harfbuzz is currently used in Emacs, we'll be missing out on the
following Alegreya ligatures:
#+begin_center
ff /ff/ ffi /ffi/ ffj /ffj/ ffl /ffl/
fft /fft/ fi /fi/ fj /fj/ ft /ft/
Th /Th/
#+end_center

Thankfully, it isn't to hard to add these to the ~composition-function-table~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?T '(["\\(?:Th\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))

**** Variable pitch serif font

#+call: confpkg()

It would be nice if we were able to make use of a serif version of the

    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
#+end_src

For ease of use, let's also set up an easy way of setting the ~:font~ attribute.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defcustom variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "serif")
  "The font face used for `variable-pitch-serif'."
  :group 'basic-faces
  :type '(restricted-sexp :tag "font-spec" :match-alternatives (fontp))
  :set (lambda (symbol value)

*** Centaur Tabs

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Centaur Tabs")

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui tabs= module.
#+end_quote

We want to make the tabs a nice, comfy size (~36~), with icons. The modifier
marker is nice, but the particular default Unicode one causes a lag spike, so
let's just switch to an ~o~, which still looks decent but doesn't cause any
issues.
An 'active-bar' is nice, so let's have one of those. If we have it ~under~ needs us to
turn on ~x-underline-at-decent~ though. For some reason this didn't seem to work
inside the src_elisp{(after! ... )} block ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Then let's change the font to a sans serif, but the default one doesn't fit too
well somehow, so let's switch to 'P22 Underground Book'; it looks much nicer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! centaur-tabs
  (centaur-tabs-mode -1)
  (setq centaur-tabs-height 36
        centaur-tabs-set-icons t
        centaur-tabs-modified-marker "o"
        centaur-tabs-close-button "×"
        centaur-tabs-set-bar 'above
        centaur-tabs-gray-out-icons 'buffer)
  (centaur-tabs-change-fonts "P22 Underground Book" 160))
;; (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
#+end_src

*** Nerd Icons

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Nerd Icons")

This is better than ~all-the-icons~, according to some guy on reddit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! nerd-icons
  (when-let ((matlab-icon (assoc "matlab" nerd-icons-extension-icon-alist)))
    (setcdr (assoc "m" nerd-icons-extension-icon-alist)
            (cdr matlab-icon))))
#+end_src

*** Prettier page breaks

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg page break lines")

In some files, =^L= appears as a page break character. This isn't that visually
appealing, and Steve Purcell has been nice enough to make a package to display
these as horizontal rules.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! page-break-lines :recipe (:host github :repo "purcell/page-break-lines"))
#+end_src

We can go from "better" to "where has this been all my life?" by now making page
navigation easy with some simple keybindings lifted from [[http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/modernization_formfeed.html][Xah Lee]]'s post on the
form feed. Making ~forward-page~ and ~backward-page~ work with Evil mode also takes
a little tweaking, so we might as well do that too while we're at it.

We can also make the displayed horizontal rule communicate more useful
information by making it the same as the fill column. While this could be
accomplished by just =setq=ing the rule width to the default ~fill-column~ value,
it would be better for it to always match the local buffer value. This may be
accomplished with advise, but it's a bit cleaner (and even simpler) to just turn
the width variable into an alias for ~fill-column~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! page-break-lines
  :hook (prog-mode . page-break-lines-mode)
  :init
  (autoload 'turn-on-page-break-lines-mode "page-break-lines")
  :config
  (defvaralias 'page-break-lines-max-width 'fill-column)
  (defun +evil-forward-page ()
    "Call `forward-page', such that it works as intended with evil-mode."
    (interactive)
    (when (eq (char-after (point)) ?\^L)
      (forward-char 1))
    (forward-page))
  (defun +evil-backward-page ()
    "Call `backward-page', such that it works as intended with evil-mode."
    (interactive)
    (when (eq (char-after (point)) ?\^L)
      (backward-char 1))
    (backward-page))
  (map! :prefix "g"
        :desc "Prev page break" :nv "[" #'+evil-backward-page
        :desc "Next page break" :nv "]" #'+evil-forward-page)
  (map! "<C-M-prior>" #'+evil-backward-page
        "<C-M-next>" #'+evil-forward-page))
#+end_src

With this setup, I find form-feeds to be a really convenient addition to my
coding workflow. Despite generally poor adoption, they are the only
language-independent form that "just works". While you could also use specially
crafted comment forms and a more complex setup, it's not as though the form-feed
is being used for anything else --- it's free real estate! 😉

*** Visual fill column

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg visual-fill-column", after="visual-fill-column")

This is already loaded by Doom, but it needs a patch applied for Emacs 29. I've
emailed this to the maintainer, hopefully Joost will take a look at it.

#+begin_example
Account for remapping in window width calculation

The window width calculation in
`visual-fill-column--window-max-text-width' uses `window-width' with the
active window as the sole argument. As of Emacs 29, this returns the
width of the window using the default face, even if the default face has
been remapped in the window: causing incorrect results when the window
is remapped.

Emacs 29 also introduces a special second argument value, `remap'
which (as we want) uses the remapped face, if applicable. This corrects
the width calculation. However, margin calculations are still done in
terms of the non-remapped default face, and so a conversion factor needs
to be applied when considering margins.
#+end_example

That's the problem/fix, I'll just overwrite the two functions in question with
the fixed versions for now.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +visual-fill-column--window-max-text-width--fixed (&optional window)
  "Return the maximum possible text width of WINDOW.

*** Elcord

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Elcord")

What's even the point of using Emacs unless you're constantly telling everyone
about it?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! elcord)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! elcord
  :commands elcord-mode
  :config
  (setq elcord-use-major-mode-as-main-icon t))

;; We disable this by default
;; (elcord-mode)
#+end_src

** File Types
*** Systemd

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Systemd")

Wonderful for editing unitfiles, as one does...
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! systemd)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! systemd
  :defer t)
#+end_src

*** PDF Tools

#+confpk("!Pkg pdf-tools")

It is convenient to have these automagically installed for us.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! pdf-tools
  :config
  (pdf-tools-install))
#+end_src

* Language Configuration

** File type defaults

#+call: confpkg()

For some file types, we overwrite defaults in the [[file:./snippets][snippets]] directory, others
need to have a template assigned.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-file-template! "\\.tex$" :trigger "__" :mode 'latex-mode)
(set-file-template! "\\.org$" :trigger "__" :mode 'org-mode)
(set-file-template! "/LICEN[CS]E$" :trigger '+file-templates/insert-license)
#+end_src

** Plaintext

#+call: confpkg()

It's nice to see ANSI colour codes displayed, however we don't want to disrupt
ANSI codes in Org src blocks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! text-mode
  (add-hook! 'text-mode-hook
    (unless (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
      ;; Apply ANSI color codes
      (with-silent-modifications
        (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max) t)))))
#+end_src

** Org
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org
:END:

:intro:
Arguably Emacs' greatest feature.
:end:

There's so much to be said about this, I don't even know how or where to begin.

*** System Setup
**** MIME-Type

Org is not usually recognized as its own ~MIMEtype~ by default.
But we can easily fix that like so:

#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments no
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">
    <comment>Emacs Org-mode File</comment>
    <glob pattern="*.org"/>
    <alias type="text/org"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>
#+end_src

What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src
Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
xdg-mime default emacs.desktop text/org
#+end_src


**** Git Diff

Protesilaos wrote a [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-26-git-diff-hunk-elisp-org/][very helpful article]] in which he explains how to change the
git diff chunk heading to something more useful than just the immediate line
above the hunk --- like the parent heading.

This can be achieved by first adding a new diff mode to git in =~/.config/git/attributes=
#+begin_src gitattributes
,*.org   diff=org
#+end_src

Then adding a regex for it to =~/.config/git/config=
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

*** Packages
**** Org itself

#+end_src

***** Emphasis Markers

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg org-appear")

While ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ is very nice, it can sometimes make edits which
occur at the border a bit more fiddley. We can improve this situation without
sacrificing visual amenities with the =org-appear= package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-appear :recipe (:host github :repo "awth13/org-appear"))

  (run-at-time nil nil #'org-appear--set-elements))
#+end_src

**** Extra Functionality

***** Transclusion

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg org-transclusion")

There's a really cool package in development to /transclude/ Org document content.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-transclusion :recipe (:host github :repo "nobiot/org-transclusion"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-transclusion
  :commands org-transclusion-mode
  :init
  (map! :after org :map org-mode-map
        "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-mode))
#+end_src

***** Document Structure as a Graph

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg org-graph-view")

Came across this and ... it's cool
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-graph-view :recipe (:host github :repo "alphapapa/org-graph-view"))
#+end_src

***** Just Another Pandoc Format

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg org-pandoc-import")

Sometimes I'm given non-org files, that's very sad. Luckily Pandoc offers a way
to make that right again, and this package makes that even easier to do.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-pandoc-import :recipe
  (:host github :repo "tecosaur/org-pandoc-import" :files ("*.el" "filters" "preprocessors")))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-pandoc-import
  :after org)
#+end_src

***** Comparing Documents

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg orgdiff")

It's quite nice to compare Org files, and the richest way to compare content is
probably =latexdiff=. There are a few annoying steps involved here, and so I've
written a package to streamline the process.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! orgdiff :recipe (:host github :repo "tecosaur/orgdiff"))
#+end_src

The only little annoyance is the fact that =latexdiff= uses ~#FF0000~ and ~#0000FF~ as
the red/blue change indication colours. We can make this a bit nicer by
post-processing the =latexdiff= result.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! orgdiff
  :defer t
  :config

*** Behavior

#+call: confpkg("Org Behavior", after="org")

**** Tweaking Defaults

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/Documents/org/"      ; Where I want my org files
      org-agenda-files (list org-directory) ; This seems like it should be obvious
      org-use-property-inheritance t        ; It's convenient to inherit properties from supersections.
      org-log-done 'time                    ; The time an item is done
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t         ; Make a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart      ; Try not to mess up invisible regions
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{}  ; sub/superscript require _{}/^{}
      org-export-allow-bind-keywords t)     ; Bind keywords? TODO: Figure out what that means
#+end_src

We should also set up some deafult header args...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      '((:session . "none")
        (:results . "replace")
        (:exports . "code")
        (:cache . "no")
        (:noweb . "no")
        (:hlines . "no")
        (:tangle . "no")
        (:comments . "link")))
#+end_src

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src

**** Extra Functionality

***** Zero-Width Spaces

Occasionally in Org you run into annoyances where you want to have two seperate
blocks right together without a space. For example, to *emp​h*​asise part of a word,
or put a currency symbol immediately before an inline source block.
There is a solution to this, it just sounds slightly hacky --- zero width spaces.
Because this is Emacs, we can make this feel much less hacky by making a minor
addition to the Org key map 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :nie "M-SPC M-SPC" (cmd! (insert "\u200B")))
#+end_src

We then want to stop the space from being included in exports, which is done
[[*Strip zero width spaces][here]]

***** List bullet sequence

I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src

***** Easier file links

While ~org-insert-link~ is all very well and good, a large portion of the time I
want to insert a file, and so it would be good to have a way to skip straight to
that and avoid the description prompt. Looking at ~org-link-parameters~, we can
see that the ="file"= link type uses the completion function
~org-link-complete-file~, so let's use that to make a little file-link inserting
function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-insert-file-link ()
  "Insert a file link.  At the prompt, enter the filename."
  (interactive)
  (org-insert-link nil (org-link-complete-file)))
#+end_src

Now we'll just add that under the Org mode link localleader for convenience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :after org
      :map org-mode-map
      :localleader
      "l f" #'+org-insert-file-link)
#+end_src

***** cdlatex environments

I prefer =auto-activating-snippets= to =cdlatex=, but do like
~org-cdlatex-environment-indent~ (bound to =C-c }=). I almost always want to edit
them afterwards though, so let's make that happen by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +org-edit-latex-env-after-insert-a (&rest _)
  :after #'org-cdlatex-environment-indent
  (org-edit-latex-environment))
#+end_src

***** LSP support in ~src~ blocks

Now, by default, LSPs don't really function at all in ~src~ blocks.
But they're really useful and I'd like to have them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(cl-defmacro lsp-org-babel-enable (lang)
  "Support LANG in org source code block."
  (setq centaur-lsp 'lsp-mode)
  (cl-check-type lang string)
  (let* ((edit-pre (intern (format "org-babel-edit-prep:%s" lang)))
         (intern-pre (intern (format "lsp--%s" (symbol-name edit-pre)))))
    `(progn
       (defun ,intern-pre (info)
         (let ((file-name (->> info caddr (alist-get :file))))
           (unless file-name
             (setq file-name (make-temp-file "babel-lsp-")))
           (setq buffer-file-name file-name)
           (lsp-deferred)))
       (put ',intern-pre 'function-documentation
            (format "Enable lsp-mode in the buffer of org source block (%s)."
                    (upcase ,lang)))
       (if (fboundp ',edit-pre)
           (advice-add ',edit-pre :after ',intern-pre)
         (progn
           (defun ,edit-pre (info)
             (,intern-pre info))
           (put ',edit-pre 'function-documentation
                (format "Prepare local buffer environment for org source block (%s)."
                        (upcase ,lang))))))))
(defvar org-babel-lang-list
  '("go" "python" "ipython" "bash" "sh"))
(dolist (lang org-babel-lang-list)
  (eval `(lsp-org-babel-enable ,lang)))
#+end_src

***** View exported file

='localeader v= has no pre-existing binding, so I may as well use it with the same
functionality as in LaTeX. Let's try viewing possible output files with this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :localleader
      :desc "View exported file" "v" #'org-view-output-file)

(defun org-view-output-file (&optional org-file-path)
  "Visit buffer open on the first output file (if any) found, using `org-view-output-file-extensions'"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((org-file-path (or org-file-path (buffer-file-name) ""))
         (dir (file-name-directory org-file-path))
         (basename (file-name-base org-file-path))
         (output-file nil))
    (dolist (ext org-view-output-file-extensions)
      (unless output-file
        (when (file-exists-p

                             (find-file-noselect output-file))))
      (message "No exported file found"))))

**** Snippet Helpers

I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-header-p ()
  "Determine whether `point' is within a src-block header or header-args."
  (pcase (org-element-type (org-element-context))
    ('src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the src-block
                   (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                   (forward-line 1)
                                   (point))))
    ('inline-src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the inline-src-block
                          (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                          (search-forward "]{")
                                          (point))))
    ('keyword (string-match-p "^header-args" (org-element-property :value (org-element-context))))))
#+end_src

Now let's write a function we can reference in yasnippets to produce a nice
interactive way to specify header args.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-prompt-header-arg (arg question values)
  "Prompt the user to set ARG header property to one of VALUES with QUESTION.
The default value is identified and indicated. If either default is selected,
or no selection is made: nil is returned."
  (let* ((src-block-p (not (looking-back "^#\\+property:[ \t]+header-args:.*" (line-beginning-position))))
         (default
           (or
            (cdr (assoc arg
                        (if src-block-p
                            (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info t))
                          (org-babel-merge-params
                           org-babel-default-header-args
                           (let ((lang-headers

                                                  (+yas/org-src-lang)))))
                             (when (boundp lang-headers) (eval lang-headers t)))))))
            ""))
         default-value)
    (setq values (mapcar
                  (lambda (value)
                    (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote value) default)
                        (setq default-value
                              (concat value " "
                                      (propertize "(default)" 'face 'font-lock-doc-face)))
                      value))

                  (string= "" selection))
        selection))))
#+end_src

Finally, we fetch the language information for new source blocks.

Since we're getting this info, we might as well go a step further and also
provide the ability to determine the most popular language in the buffer that
doesn't have any =header-args= set for it (with =#+properties=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+property: +header-args" nil t)

    (setq src-langs

**** Translate capital keywords (old) to lower case (new)

is actually both marginally easier and visually nicer, so now the capital
version is just used in the manual.

Org is standardized on lower case. Uppercase is used in the manual as a poor
man's bold, and supported for historical reasons. --- [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tuuw3n15.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][Nicolas Goaziou on the Org ML]]

**** Fix problematic hooks

When one of the src_elisp{org-mode-hook} functions errors, it halts the hook

cause issues. Let's make their failure less eventful.

**** Flycheck with org-lint

#+call: confpkg("Flycheck org-lint", after=["org" "flycheck"])

Org may be simple, but that doesn't mean there's no such thing as malformed Org.
Thankfully, malformed Org is a much less annoying affair than malformed zipped
XML (looks at DOCX/ODT...), particularly because there's a rather helpful little
tool called ~org-lint~ bundled with Org that can tell you about your mistakes.

[[xkcd:2109]]

Flycheck doesn't currently support Org, and there's aren't any packages to do so
☹. However, in an issue on ~org-lint~ there is [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/1757#issuecomment-759546940][some code]] which apparently works.
Surely this is what the clipboard was invented for? With that said, let's
regurgitate the code, cross our fingers, and hope it works.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no

Turns out it almost works. Running =M-x flycheck-verify-setup= after running that
snippet produces the following:
#+begin_example
The following syntax checkers are not registered:
  - org-lint
Try adding these syntax checkers to `flycheck-checkers'.
#+end_example

Well that's very nice and helpful. We'll just do that 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'org-lint)
#+end_src

It was missing custom link types, but that's easily fixed just by adding
~org-link-parameters~ to ~flycheck-org-lint-variables~.

One remaining little annoyance is that it reports extra =#+options= that I've
added to Org as errors. So we need to tell ~org-lint~ about them without having it
load my whole config. Code duplication isn't great, but at least this isn't
much.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun flycheck-org-lint-customisations-form ()
  `(progn
     (require 'ox)
     (cl-pushnew '(:latex-cover-page nil "coverpage" nil)
                 (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex)))
     (cl-pushnew '(:latex-font-set nil "fontset" nil)
                 (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex)))))
#+end_src

A larger annoyance is that org-lint doesn't actually know what languages
org-babel should recognise, with Doom's lazy loading system. Since the list of
languages should really only change when packages are added/removed, we might as
well statically determine a list of all org-babel languages at configuration
generation time.

#+name: org-babel-list-langs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none
(let (langs)
  (dolist (dir load-path)
    (when (file-directory-p dir)
      (dolist (file (directory-files dir t "\\.elc?$"))
        (let ((basename (file-name-base file)))
          (when (string-prefix-p "ob-" basename)
            (ignore-errors
              (require (intern basename) file t)))))))
  (mapatoms
   (lambda (symb)
     (when (functionp symb)
       (let ((name (symbol-name symb)))
         (let ((fn (symbol-function symb)))
           (when (symbolp fn)
             (setq symb (symbol-function symb)
                   fn (symbol-function symb)))
           (when (and (string-suffix-p "-mode" name)
                      (autoloadp fn))
             (ignore-errors (autoload-do-load fn))))
         (cond
          ((string-prefix-p "org-babel-execute:" name)
           (push (replace-regexp-in-string "^org-babel-execute:" "" name)
                 langs))
          ((and (string-suffix-p "-mode" name)
                (provided-mode-derived-p
                 symb 'prog-mode 'text-mode 'conf-mode))
           (push (replace-regexp-in-string "-mode$" "" name)
                 langs))))))
   obarray)
  (dolist (mode-mapping org-src-lang-modes)
    (push (car mode-mapping) langs))
  (mapcar #'intern
          (sort (delete-dups langs) #'string<)))
#+end_src

This increases the tangle time by about 10--20%, but I think it's worth it to be
extra thorough. If this really becomes a pain, we can always think about doing
some sort of cache file based on the load-path/packages installed.

*** Visuals

#+call: confpkg("Org Visuals", after="org")

**** Font Display

I like my org to be pretty.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Also let's make headings a bit larger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And maybe titles, too
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

Org files can be rather nice to look at, particularly with some of the
customisations here. This comes at a cost however, expensive font-lock.
Feeling like you're typing through molasses in large files is no fun, but there
is a way I can defer font-locking when typing to make the experience more
responsive.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;TODO: This can cause massive issues for some people. Check if I'm affected.
(defun locally-defer-font-lock ()
  "Set jit-lock defer and stealth, when buffer is over a certain size."
  (when (> (buffer-size) 50000)
    (setq-local jit-lock-defer-time 0.05
                jit-lock-stealth-time 1)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'locally-defer-font-lock)
#+end_src

**** Reduce Indentation

Due to some of the previous adjustments, anything that isn't a heading will feel overly indentend.
We can easily fix that.
This also has some fixes for ~mixed-pitch-mode~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +org-indent--reduced-text-prefixes ()
  :after #'org-indent--compute-prefixes
  (setq org-indent--text-line-prefixes
        (make-vector org-indent--deepest-level nil))
  (when (> org-indent-indentation-per-level 0)
    (dotimes (n org-indent--deepest-level)
      (aset org-indent--text-line-prefixes
            n
            (org-add-props
                (concat (make-string (* n (1- org-indent-indentation-per-level))
                                     ?\s)
                        (if (> n 0)
                             (char-to-string org-indent-boundary-char)
                          "\u200b"))
                nil 'face 'org-indent)))))
#+end_src

**** Symbols

It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ellipsis " ▾ "
      org-hide-leading-stars t
      org-priority-highest ?A
      org-priority-lowest ?E
      org-priority-faces
      '((?A . 'nerd-icons-red)
        (?B . 'nerd-icons-orange)
        (?C . 'nerd-icons-yellow)
        (?D . 'nerd-icons-green)
        (?E . 'nerd-icons-blue)))
#+end_src

It's also nice to make use of the =prettify-symbols-mode= for a few Org syntactic
tokens which we'd like to prettify that aren't covered by =org-modern= or any
other settings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +org-init-appearance-h--no-ligatures-a ()
  :after #'+org-init-appearance-h
  (set-ligatures! 'org-mode nil)
  (set-ligatures! 'org-mode
    :list_property "::"
    :em_dash       "---"
    :ellipsis      "..."
    :arrow_right   "->"
    :arrow_left    "<-"
    :arrow_lr      "<->"
    :properties    ":PROPERTIES:"
    :end           ":END:"
    :priority_a    "[#A]"
    :priority_b    "[#B]"
    :priority_c    "[#C]"
    :priority_d    "[#D]"
    :priority_e    "[#E]"))
#+end_src

**** LaTeX Fragments
***** Prettier highlighting

First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src

***** Automatic previewing

It would be nice if fragments could automatically be previewed after being
typed, and the overlays automatically showed and hidden when moving the point in
and out of the LaTeX fragments.

Thankfully, all we need to do to make this happen is use ~org-latex-preview-auto-mode~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-latex-preview-auto-mode)
#+end_src

***** Prettier rendering

It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).

The default snippet preamble basically just sets the margins and text size, with
templates to be filled in by ~org-latex-default-packages-alist~ and
=#+latex_header:= entries (but not =#+latex_header_extra:=).

#+name: latex-default-snippet-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\documentclass{article}
[DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
[PACKAGES]
\usepackage{xcolor}
#+end_src

To this, we make two additions:
+ Selection of a maths font that fits better with displayed text.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(setq org-latex-preview-preamble
      (concat
       <<grab("latex-default-snippet-preamble")>>
       "\n% Custom font\n\\usepackage{arev}\n\n"
       <<grab("latex-maths-conveniences")>>))
#+end_src

Since we can, instead of making the background colour match the =default= face,
let's make it transparent.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Calibrated based on the TeX font and org-buffer font
(plist-put org-format-latex-options :zoom 0.93)
#+end_src

**** Org Plot

We can use some of the variables in =org-plot= to use the current doom theme
colours.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +org-plot-term-size '(1050 . 650)

*** Exporting

#+call: confpkg("Org exports", after="ox")

**** General settings

By default Org only exports the first three levels of headings as ... headings.
This is rather unfortunate as my documents frequently stray far beyond three
levels of depth. The two main formats I care about exporting to are LaTeX and
HTML. When using an =article= class, LaTeX headlines go from =\section=,
=\subsection=, =\subsubsection=, and =\paragraph= to =\subgraph= --- /five/ levels.
HTML5 has six levels of headings (=<h1>= to =<h6>=), but first level Org headings
get exported as =<h2>= elements --- leaving /five/ usable levels.

As such, it would seem to make sense to recognise the first /five/ levels of Org
headings when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 5) ; I like nesting
#+end_src

I'm also going to make use of an item in =ox-extra= so that I can add an =:ignore:=
tag to headings for the content to be kept, but the heading itself ignored
(unlike =:noexport:= which ignored both heading and content). This is useful when
I want to use headings to provide a structure for writing that doesn't appear in
the final documents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)
(ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
#+end_src

**** Acronym formatting

I like automatically using spaced small caps for acronyms. For strings I want to
be unaffected let's use ~;~ as a prefix to prevent the transformation --- i.e.
~;JFK~ (as one would want for two-letter geographic locations and names).

This has to be implemented on a per-format basis, currently HTML and LaTeX
exports are supported.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-export-filter-text-acronym (text backend _info)
  "Wrap suspected acronyms in acronyms-specific formatting.

**** Nicer generated heading IDs

Thanks to alphapapa's [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][unpackaged.el]].

By default, Org generated heading IDs like =#org80fc2a5= which ... works, but has
two issues
+ It's completely uninformative, I have no idea what's being referenced
+ If I export the same file, everything will change.
  Now, while without hardcoded values it's impossible to set references in
  stone, it would be nice for there to be a decent chance of staying the same.

Both of these issues can be addressed by generating IDs like
=#language-configuration=, which is what I'll do here.

It's worth noting that alphapapa's use of ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me
some issues. Replacing that in ~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step
further, I create a function for producing nice short links, like an inferior
version of ~reftex-label~.

**** Custom CSS/JS

The default org HTML export is ... alright, but we can really jazz it up.
[[https://lepisma.xyz][lepisma.xyz]] has a really nice style, and from and org export too!
Suffice to say I've snatched it, with a few of my own tweaks applied.

**** Collapsable src and example blocks

By wrapping the ~<pre>~ element in a ~<details>~ block, we can obtain collapsable
blocks with no CSS, though we will toss a little in anyway to have this looking
somewhat spiffy.

Since this collapsability seems useful to have on by default for certain chunks
of code, it would be nice if you could set it with =#+attr_html: :collapsed t=.

It would be nice to also have a corresponding global / session-local way of
setting this, but I haven't quite been able to get that working (yet).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-html-export-collapsed nil)
(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:collapsed "COLLAPSED" "collapsed" org-html-export-collapsed t)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'html))))
(add-to-list 'org-default-properties "EXPORT_COLLAPSED")
#+end_src

We can take our src block modification a step further, and add a gutter on the
side of the src block containing both an anchor referencing the current block,
and a button to copy the content of the block.

**** Include extra font-locking in htmlize

Org uses [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize.el]] to export buffers with syntax highlighting.

The works fantastically, for the most part. Minor modes that provide
font-locking are /not/ loaded, and so do not impact the result.

By enabling these modes in ~htmlize-before-hook~ we can correct this behaviour.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

**** Handle table overflow

In order to accommodate wide tables ---particularly on mobile devices--- we want
to set a maximum width and scroll overflow. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied
directly to the ~table~ element, so we have to wrap it in a ~div~.

While we're at it, we can a link gutter, as we did with src blocks, and show the
~#+name~, if one is given.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html-table-wrapped (orig-fn table contents info)
  "Wrap the usual <table> in a <div>"
  :around #'org-html-table
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn table contents info)
    (let* ((name (plist-get (cadr table) :name))
           (ref (org-export-get-reference table info)))
      (format "<div id='%s' class='table'>
<div class='gutter'><a href='#%s'>#</a></div>
<div class='tabular'>
%s
</div>\
</div>"
              ref ref
              (if name
                  (replace-regexp-in-string (format "<table id=\"%s\"" ref) "<table"
                                            (funcall orig-fn table contents info))
                (funcall orig-fn table contents info))))))
#+end_src

**** TOC as a collapsable tree

The TOC is much nicer to navigate as a collapsable tree. Unfortunately we cannot
achieve this with CSS alone. Thankfully we can avoid JS though, by adapting the
TOC generation code to use a ~label~ for each item, and a hidden ~checkbox~ to keep
track of state.

Since we can actually accomplish the desired effect by adding advice /around/ the
function, without overriding it --- let's do that to reduce the bug surface of
this config a tad.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable (orig-fn headline info)
  "Add a label and checkbox to `org-html--format-toc-headline's usual output,
to allow the TOC to be a collapseable tree."
  :around #'org-html--format-toc-headline
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn headline info)
    (let ((id (or (org-element-property :CUSTOM_ID headline)
                  (org-export-get-reference headline info))))
      (format "<input type='checkbox' id='toc--%s'/><label for='toc--%s'>%s</label>"
              id id (funcall orig-fn headline info)))))
#+end_src

Now, leaves (headings with no children) shouldn't have the ~label~ item. The
obvious way to achieve this is by including some /if no children.../ logic in
~org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable~. Unfortunately, I can't my elisp isn't
up to par to extract the number of child headings from the mountain of info that
org provides.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--toc-text-stripped-leaves (orig-fn toc-entries)
  "Remove label"
  :around #'org-html--toc-text
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn toc-entries)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "<input [^>]+><label [^>]+>\\(.+?\\)</label></li>" "\\1</li>"
                              (funcall orig-fn toc-entries))))
#+end_src

**** Make verbatim different to code

Since we have =verbatim= and ~code~, let's make use of the difference.

We can use ~code~ exclusively for code snippets and commands like: "calling
src_elisp{(message "Hello")} in batch-mode Emacs prints to stdout like ~echo~".
Then we can use =verbatim= for miscellaneous 'other monospace' like keyboard
shortcuts: "either =C-c C-c= or =C-g= is likely the most useful keybinding in Emacs",
or file names: "I keep my configuration in =~/.config/doom/=", among other things.

Then, styling these two cases differently can help improve clarity in a document.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "<b>%s</b>")
        (code . "<code>%s</code>")
        (italic . "<i>%s</i>")
        (strike-through . "<del>%s</del>")
        (underline . "<span class=\"underline\">%s</span>")
        (verbatim . "<kbd>%s</kbd>")))
#+end_src

**** Change checkbox type

We also want to use HTML checkboxes, however we want to get a bit fancier than default
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(appendq! org-html-checkbox-types
          '((html-span
             (on . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")
             (off . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")
             (trans . "<span class='checkbox'></span>"))))
(setq org-html-checkbox-type 'html-span)
#+end_src
- [ ] I'm yet to do this

**** Extra special strings

The ~org-html-special-string-regexps~ variable defines substitutions for:
+ =\-=, a shy hyphen
+ =---=, an em dash
+ =--=, an en dash
+ =...=, (horizontal) ellipses

However I think it would be nice if there was also a substitution for left/right
arrows (=->= and =<-=). This is a ~defconst~, but as you may tell from the amount of
advice in this config, I'm not above messing with things I'm not 'supposed' to.

The only minor complication is that =<= and =>= are converted to =&lt;= and =&gt;=
before this stage of output processing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(pushnew! org-html-special-string-regexps
          '("-&gt;" . "&#8594;")
          '("&lt;-" . "&#8592;"))
#+end_src

**** Header anchors

I want to add GitHub-style links on hover for headings.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-export-html-headline-anchor (text backend info)
  (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
             (not (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 're-reveal))
             org-fancy-html-export-mode)
    (unless (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress)
      (replace-regexp-in-string
       "<h\\([0-9]\\) id=\"\\([a-z0-9-]+\\)\">\\(.*[^ ]\\)<\\/h[0-9]>" ; this is quite restrictive, but due to `org-reference-contraction' I can do this
       "<h\\1 id=\"\\2\">\\3<a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#\\2\">#</a> </h\\1>"
       text))))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-headline-functions
             'org-export-html-headline-anchor)
#+end_src

**** Link previews

Sometimes it's nice to make a link particularly prominent, an embed/preview like
Twitter does would be nice I think.

We can do this without too much trouble by adding a new link type ever so
slightly different from =https= --- =Https=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameters "Https"
                         :follow (lambda (url arg) (browse-url (concat "https:" url) arg))
                         :export #'org-url-fancy-export)
#+end_src

Then, if we can fetch a plist of the form src_elisp{(:title "..." :description
"..." :image "...")} for such links via a function ~org-url-unfurl-metadata~, we
can make a fancy export.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-url-fancy-export (url _desc backend)
  (let ((metadata (org-url-unfurl-metadata (concat "https:" url))))
    (cond
     ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
      (concat
       "<div class=\"link-preview\">"
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">" (concat "https:" url))
       (when (plist-get metadata :image)
         (format "<img src=\"%s\"/>" (plist-get metadata :image)))
       "<small>"
       (replace-regexp-in-string "//\\(?:www\\.\\)?\\([^/]+\\)/?.*" "\\1" url)
       "</small><p>"
       (when (plist-get metadata :title)
         (concat "<b>" (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :title)) "</b></br>"))
       (when (plist-get metadata :description)
         (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :description)))
       "</p></a></div>"))
     (t url))))
#+end_src

Now we just need to actually implement that metadata extraction function.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache nil)
(defun org-url-unfurl-metadata (url)
  (cdr (or (assoc url org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache)

                                (progn (message "Fetching metadata from %s" url)
                                       (if (executable-find "curl")

(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 latexmk -f -pdf -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

**** Nicer checkboxes

We'll assume that thanks to the clever preamble the various custom =\checkbox...=
commands below are defined.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes (text backend info)
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
    (replace-regexp-in-string
     "\\\\item\\[{$\\\\\\(\\w+\\)$}\\]"
     (lambda (fullmatch)
       (concat "\\\\item[" (pcase (substring fullmatch 9 -3) ; content of capture group
                             ("square"   "\\\\checkboxUnchecked")
                             ("boxminus" "\\\\checkboxTransitive")
                             ("boxtimes" "\\\\checkboxChecked")
                             (_ (substring fullmatch 9 -3))) "]"))
     text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-item-functions
             '+org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes)
#+end_src

**** Class templates

I really like the KOMA bundle. It provides a set of mechanisms to tweak document
styling which is both easy to use, and quite comprehensive.
For example, I rather like section numbers in the margin, which can be
accomplished with
#+name: latex-hanging-secnum
#+begin_src LaTeX
\renewcommand\sectionformat{\llap{\thesection\autodot\enskip}}
\renewcommand\subsectionformat{\llap{\thesubsection\autodot\enskip}}
\renewcommand\subsubsectionformat{\llap{\thesubsubsection\autodot\enskip}}
#+end_src

It can also be nice to have big =\chapter=​s.
#+name: latex-big-chapter
#+begin_src LaTeX
\RedeclareSectionCommand[afterindent=false, beforeskip=0pt, afterskip=0pt, innerskip=0pt]{chapter}
\setkomafont{chapter}{\normalfont\Huge}
\renewcommand*{\chapterheadstartvskip}{\vspace*{0\baselineskip}}
\renewcommand*{\chapterheadendvskip}{\vspace*{0\baselineskip}}
\renewcommand*{\chapterformat}{%
  \fontsize{60}{30}\selectfont\rlap{\hspace{6pt}\thechapter}}
\renewcommand*\chapterlinesformat[3]{%
  \parbox[b]{\dimexpr\textwidth-0.5em\relax}{%
    \raggedleft{{\large\scshape\bfseries\chapapp}\vspace{-0.5ex}\par\Huge#3}}%
    \hfill\makebox[0pt][l]{#2}}
#+end_src

Now let's just sprinkle some KOMA all over the Org LaTeX classes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no

      org-latex-hyperref-template
      <<grab("latex-fancy-hyperref")>>
      org-latex-reference-command "\\cref{%s}")
#+end_src


The =hyperref= setup needs to be handled separately however.

**** A cleverer preamble
***** Use case

We often want particular snippets of LaTeX in our documents preambles.
It's a pain to have to work out / remember them every time.

We could have every package we could possibly need in every one of
~org-latex-classes~, but that's /horribly/ inefficient and I don't want to think
about maintaining that.

Instead we can provide some granularity by splitting up the features we want,
and then take the experience to a whole new level by implementing a system to
automatically detect which features are desired and generating a preamble that
provides these features.

***** Conditional Content

Let's consider content we want in particular situations.

Captions could do with a bit of tweaking such that
+ You can easily have multiple captions
+ Links to figures take you to the /top/ of the figure (not the bottom)
+ Caption labels could do with being emphasised slightly more
+ Multiline captions should run ragged-right, but only when then span more than
  one line

#+name: org-latex-caption-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage[hypcap=true]{caption}
\setkomafont{caption}{\sffamily\small}
\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\upshape\bfseries}
\captionsetup{justification=raggedright,singlelinecheck=true}
\usepackage{capt-of} % required by Org
#+end_src

The default checkboxes look rather ugly, so let's provide some prettier alternatives.

#+name: org-latex-checkbox-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\newcommand{\checkboxUnchecked}{$\square$}
\newcommand{\checkboxTransitive}{\rlap{\raisebox{-0.1ex}{\hspace{0.35ex}\Large\textbf -}}$\square$}
\newcommand{\checkboxChecked}{\rlap{\raisebox{0.2ex}{\hspace{0.35ex}\scriptsize \ding{52}}}$\square$}
#+end_src

We set up a maths typesetting preamble [[*Maths notation conveniences][later on]], but it would be nice to save it
to a variable here:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(defvar org-latex-maths-preamble
  <<grab("latex-maths-conveniences")>>
  "Preamble that sets up a bunch of mathematical conveniences.")
#+end_src

It's nice to have "message blocks", things like info/warning/error/success.
A LaTeX macro should make them trivial to create.

Lastly, we will pass this content into some global variables we for ease of

In the "universal preamble", we already embed the source =.org= file, but it would
be nice to embed all the tangled files. This is fairly easy to accomplish by
mapping each tangled file to a form which embeds the file if it exists.
Considering we're going this far, why not add a dedicated =#+emded= keyword, so we
can embed whatever we want.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

                          (replace-regexp-in-string "~" "\\\\string~"))
             (cdr file-desc)))
   (append
    (let (tangle-fspecs) ; All files being tangled to.
      (org-element-cache-map

                    (not (org-in-archived-heading-p nil src)))
           (when-let ((lang (org-element-property :language src))

             (unless (assoc tangle-file tangle-fspecs)
               (push
                (cons tangle-file (format "Tangled %s file" lang))
                tangle-fspecs)))))
       :granularity 'element

      (nreverse extra-files)))
   "\n"))
#+end_src

Now all tangled files will be embedded, and we can embed arbitrary files like
so:
#+begin_src org
,#+embed: some-file :description flavour text about the file
#+end_src

This currently won't complete or anything like that, as we haven't told Org that
it's a keyword yet. It's also LaTeX-specific, so maybe it should be changed to
=#+latex_embed= or something like that.

***** Content-feature-preamble association

Initially this idea was implemented with an alist that associated a construct
that would search the current Org file for an indication that some feature was
needed, with a LaTeX snippet to be inserted in the preamble which would provide
that feature.
This is all well and good when there is a bijection between detected features
and the LaTeX code needed to support those features, but in many cases this
relation is not injective.

To better model the reality of the situation, I add an extra layer to this
process where each detected feature gives a list of required "feature flags".
Simply be merging the lists of feature flags we no longer have to require
injectivity to avoid LaTeX duplication. Then the extra layer forms a bijection
between there feature flags and a specification which can be used to implement
the feature.

This model also provides a number of nice secondary benefits, such as a simple
implementation of feature dependency.

First we will implement the feature detection component of this model. I'd like
this to be able to use as much state information as possible, so the feature
tests should be very versatile.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-embed-files t
  "Embed the source .org, .tex, and any tangled files.")
(defvar org-latex-use-microtype t
  "Use the microtype pakage.")
(defvar org-latex-italic-quotes t
  "Make \"quote\" environments italic.")
(defvar org-latex-par-sep t
  "Vertically seperate paragraphs, and remove indentation.")

(org-export-update-features 'latex
  ((image caption)
   :condition "\\[\\[xkcd:"))
#+end_src

Then we provide a way to generate the preamble that provides those features. In
addition to the features named in ~org-latex-conditional-features~ we'll also
create /meta-features/, which can be required by other features (with =:requires=).
For further control I some features may only be used when certain other features
are active (with =:when=), and masked by other features (with =:prevents=). I will
use the convention of starting meta-features with =.=, to make their nature more
readily apparent.

Another consideration in LaTeX is load order, which matters in some cases.
Beyond that, it's nice to have some sort of sensible ordering. For this I'll
introduce an =:order= keyword. Using this I'll arrange snippets as follows.

+ =0= Typography
  - =0= Fonts themselves
  - =0.1= Typographic tweaks (=microtype=)
  - =0.2= Maths setup
  - =0.3= Maths font
  - =0.4= Extra text shaping (~\acr~)
  - =0.5-0.9= Miscellaneous text modifications, trying to put shorter snippets first
+ =1= (/default/)
+ =2= Tables and figures
+ =3= Miscellaneous short content
+ =4= Fancy boxes
+ =70= setup for non-precompilable content
+ =80= non-precompilable content

***** Adding xcolor as an unconditional package

=xcolor= is just convenient to have.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-packages-alist
      '(("" "xcolor" t)))
#+end_src

**** Font collections

Using the lovely conditional preamble, I'll define a number of font collections
that can be used for LaTeX exports. Who knows, maybe I'll use it with other
export formats too at some point.

To start with I'll create a default state variable and register =fontset= as part
of =#+options=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;(defvar org-latex-default-fontset 'alegreya
(defvar org-latex-default-fontset 'times
  "Fontset from `org-latex-fontsets' to use by default.
As cm (computer modern) is TeX's default, that causes nothing
to be added to the document.

If \"nil\" no custom fonts will ever be used.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-font-set nil "fontset" org-latex-default-fontset)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))
#+end_src

Then a function is needed to generate a LaTeX snippet which applies the fontset. It
would be nice if this could be done for individual styles and use different
styles as the main document font. If the individual typefaces for a fontset are
defined individually as
src_elisp{:serif}, src_elisp{:sans}, src_elisp{:mono}, and src_elisp{:maths}.
I can use those to generate LaTeX for subsets of the full fontset. Then, if I
don't let any fontset names have =-= in them, I can use =-sans= and =-mono= as
suffixes that specify the document font to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-fontset-entry ()
  "Get the fontset spec of the current file.
Has format \"name\" or \"name-style\" where 'name' is one of
the cars in `org-latex-fontsets'."
  (let ((fontset-spec
         (symbol-name
          (or (car (delq nil
                         (mapcar

                            (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex)
                                       :latex-font-set))
                          (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
              org-latex-default-fontset))))
    (cons (intern (car (split-string fontset-spec "-")))
          (when (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))
            (intern (concat ":" (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))))))))

(defun org-latex-fontset (&rest desired-styles)
  "Generate a LaTeX preamble snippet which applies the current fontset for DESIRED-STYLES."
  (let* ((fontset-spec (org-latex-fontset-entry))
         (fontset (alist-get (car fontset-spec) org-latex-fontsets)))
    (if fontset
        (string-trim
         (concat
          (mapconcat
           (lambda (style)
             (when (plist-get fontset style)
               (concat (plist-get fontset style) "\n")))
           desired-styles
           "")
          (when (memq (cdr fontset-spec) desired-styles)
            (pcase (cdr fontset-spec)
              (:serif "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\rmdefault}\n")
              (:sans "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\sfdefault}\n")
              (:mono "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\ttdefault}\n")))))
      (error "Font-set %s is not provided in org-latex-fontsets" (car fontset-spec)))))
#+end_src

Now that all the functionality has been implemented, we should hook it into our
preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-export-update-features 'latex
  (custom-font
   :condition org-latex-default-fontset

   :snippet (org-latex-fontset :maths)
   :after (custom-font maths)
   :order 0))
#+end_src

Finally, we just need to add some fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

When we're using Alegreya we can apply a lovely little tweak to =tabular= which
(locally) changes the figures used to lining fixed-width.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-export-update-features 'latex

#+end_src

Due to Alegreya's metrics, the =\LaTeX= symbol doesn't quite look right. We
can correct for this by redefining it with subtlety shifted kerning.

**** Maths notation conveniences
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:LaTeX: :noweb-ref latex-maths-conveniences
:END:

Maths has a way of popping up relentlessly. I think this says something both
about me and the subject itself. While the LaTeX set of commands is quite
reasonable, we can make a few common bits of notation a tad more convenient.

***** Packages

First, there are a few useful packages we want to use.

#+begin_src LaTeX
%% Maths-related packages
% More maths environments, commands, and symbols.
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb}
% Slanted fractions with \sfrac{a}{b}, in text and maths.
\usepackage{xfrac}
% Visually cancel expressions with \cancel{value} and \cancelto{expression}{value}
\usepackage[makeroom]{cancel}
% Improvements on amsmath and utilities for mathematical typesetting
\usepackage{mathtools}
#+end_src

***** Custom delimiters

Next up we want to make the various types of rounding-related and absolute value
delimitors accessible as commands.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Deliminators
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\abs}{\lvert}{\rvert}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\norm}{\lVert}{\rVert}

\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\ceil}{\lceil}{\rceil}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\floor}{\lfloor}{\rfloor}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\round}{\lfloor}{\rceil}
#+end_src

***** Number sets

Then we have the various common number sets, it would be nice to have a
convenient way of typing them and optionally giving them powers. It's fairly
easy to support both =\XX= and =\XX[n]=.

#+begin_src LaTeX
\newcommand{\NN}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{N}}{\mathbb{N}^{#1}}}} % Natural numbers
\newcommand{\ZZ}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{Z}}{\mathbb{Z}^{#1}}}} % Integer numbers
\newcommand{\QQ}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{Q}}{\mathbb{Q}^{#1}}}} % Rational numbers
\newcommand{\RR}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{R}}{\mathbb{R}^{#1}}}} % Real numbers
\newcommand{\CC}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{C}^{#1}}}} % Complex numbers
#+end_src

***** Derivatives

Derivatives are actually a bit of a pain to typeset, it would be nice to have a
=\dv= command that supports:
+ =\dv{x}= for the derivative with respect to =x=
+ =\dv{f}{x}= for the derivative of =f= with respect to =x=
+ =\dv[2]{f}{x}= for the second order derivative of =f= with respect to =x=

Similarly, it would be nice to have a partial derivate counterpart =\pdv= which
behaves in a similar way, but with the possibility of providing multiple
comma-delimited variables --- e.g. =\pdv{f}{x,y,z}=.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Easy derivatives
\ProvideDocumentCommand\dv{o m g}{%
  \IfNoValueTF{#3}{%
    \dv[#1]{}{#2}}{%
    \IfNoValueTF{#1}{%
      \frac{\dd #2}{\dd #3}%
    }{\frac{\dd[#1] #2}{\dd {#3}^{#1}}}}}
% Easy partial derivatives
\ExplSyntaxOn
\ProvideDocumentCommand\pdv{o m g}{%
  \IfNoValueTF{#3}{\pdv[#1]{}{#2}}%
  {\ifnum\clist_count:n{#3}<2
    \IfValueTF{#1}{\frac{\partial^{#1} #2}{\partial {#3}^{#1}}}%
    {\frac{\partial #2}{\partial #3}}
    \else
    \frac{\IfValueTF{#1}{\partial^{#1}}{\partial^{\clist_count:n{#3}}}#2}%
    {\clist_map_inline:nn{#3}{\partial ##1 \,}\!}
    \fi}}
\ExplSyntaxOff
#+end_src

***** Common operators

The default set of operators could benefit from a bit of expansion.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Laplacian
\DeclareMathOperator{\Lap}{\mathcal{L}}

% Statistics
\DeclareMathOperator{\Var}{Var} % varience
\DeclareMathOperator{\Cov}{Cov} % covarience
\newcommand{\EE}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{E}}} % expected value
\DeclareMathOperator{\E}{E} % expected value
#+end_src

***** Slanted inequalities

As a matter of personal taste, I prefer the slanted less/greater than or equal
to operators, and would like to use them by default.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% I prefer the slanted \leq/\geq
\let\barleq\leq % Save them in case they're every wanted
\let\bargeq\geq
\renewcommand{\leq}{\leqslant}
\renewcommand{\geq}{\geqslant}
#+end_src

***** Alignment of matrix columns

By default, everything in a matrix is centred, which I actually find often
undesirable. It would be much nicer to take the alignment as an optional
argument of the environment, and default to right-alignment.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Redefine the matrix environment to allow for alignment
% via an optional argument, and use r as the default.
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\env@matrix[1][r]{\hskip -\arraycolsep%
    \let\@ifnextchar\new@ifnextchar
    \array{*\c@MaxMatrixCols #1}}
\makeatother
#+end_src


***** Slanted derivative "d"

Determining an appropriate styling for a derivative "d" (e.g. "dx") is
surprisingly hard, as the "d" is neither:
+ An operator (which are typeset as upright roman)
+ A variable (which are typeset as italic roman)

The ISO 80000-2 standard (2009) specifies that it should be upright, however (a)
it is still not an operator, (b) not used in any maths book I've seen, and (c)
doesn't look very good. I'm not entirely comfortable with the variable styling
either though, so perhaps something else is in order?

After trying a few different options, I rather like the idea of using a /slanted
roman "d"/. This stylistically works for me, while being just distinct enough
from other faces. As long as we are creating a PDF, we can apply a transform
that slants a "d".

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Slanted roman "d" for derivatives
\ifcsname pdfoutput\endcsname
  \ifnum\pdfoutput>0 % PDF
    \newsavebox\diffdbox{}
    \newcommand{\slantedromand}{{\mathpalette\makesl{d}}}
    \newcommand{\makesl}[2]{%
      \begingroup
      \sbox{\diffdbox}{$\mathsurround=0pt#1\mathrm{#2}$}%
      \pdfsave%
      \pdfsetmatrix{1 0 0.2 1}%
      \rlap{\usebox{\diffdbox}}%
      \pdfrestore%
      \hskip\wd\diffdbox%
      \endgroup}
  \else % DVI
    \newcommand{\slantedromand}{d} % fallback
  \fi
\else % Also DVI
  \newcommand{\slantedromand}{d} % fallback
\fi
#+end_src

Now there's the matter of /placing/ the "d", or rather adjusting the space around
it. After much fiddling, I've ended up with the following.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Derivative d^n, nicely spaced
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\dd}[1][]{\mathop{}\!%
  \expandafter\ifx\expandafter&\detokenize{#1}&% \ifstrempty from etoolbox
    \slantedromand\@ifnextchar^{\hspace{0.2ex}}{\hspace{0.1ex}}
  \else
    \slantedromand\hspace{0.2ex}^{#1}
  \fi}
\makeatother
#+end_src

While =\dd= isn't much effort to type, it would be much cleaner to be able to do
src_LaTeX{\int x^2 \d x}. The problem with defining =\d= is that it is already used
for the under-dot accent. However, since this is a text-mode (only) accent, and
defined with src_LaTeX{\@dec@text@cmd\newcommand} instead of
src_LaTeX{\DeclareRobustCommand} we can redefine the command to mean =\dd= in
math-mode.

#+begin_src LaTeX
\NewCommandCopy{\daccent}{\d}
\renewcommand{\d}{\ifmmode\dd\else\daccent\fi}
#+end_src


**** Cover page

To make a nice cover page, a simple method that comes to mind is just redefining
=\maketitle=. To get precise control over the positioning we'll use the =tikz=
package, and then add in the Tikz libraries =calc= and =shapes.geometric= to make
some nice decorations for the background.

I'll start off by setting up the required additions to the preamble.
This will accomplish the following:
+ Load the required packages
+ Redefine =\maketitle=
+ Draw an Org icon with Tikz to use in the cover page (it's a little easter egg)
+ Start a new page after the table of contents by redefining =\tableofcontents=

#+name: latex-cover-page
#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}

\newsavebox\orgicon

Now we've got a nice cover page to work with, we just need to use it every now
and then. Adding this to =#+options= feels most appropriate.
Let's have the =coverpage= option accept =auto= as a value and then decide whether
or not a cover page should be used based on the word count --- I'll have this be
the global default. Then we just want to insert a LaTeX snippet tweak the
subtitle format to use the cover page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(defvar org-latex-cover-page 'auto
  "When t, use a cover page by default.
When auto, use a cover page when the document's wordcount exceeds
`org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold'.

Set with #+option: coverpage:{yes,auto,no} in org buffers.")
(defvar org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold 5000
  "Document word count at which a cover page will be used automatically.
This condition is applied when cover page option is set to auto.")
(defvar org-latex-subtitle-coverpage-format "\\\\\\bigskip\n\\LARGE\\mdseries\\itshape\\color{black!80} %s\\par"
  "Variant of `org-latex-subtitle-format' to use with the cover page.")
(defvar org-latex-cover-page-maketitle
  <<grab("latex-cover-page")>>
  "LaTeX preamble snippet that sets \\maketitle to produce a cover page.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-cover-page nil "coverpage" org-latex-cover-page)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))

(defun org-latex-cover-page-p ()
  "Whether a cover page should be used when exporting this Org file."
  (pcase (or (car
              (delq nil
                    (mapcar
                     (lambda (opt-line)
                       (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex) :latex-cover-page))
                     (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
             org-latex-cover-page)
    ((or 't 'yes) t)
    ('auto (when (> (count-words (point-min) (point-max)) org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold) t))
    (_ nil)))

(defadvice! org-latex-set-coverpage-subtitle-format-a (contents info)

  :before #'org-latex-template
  (when (org-latex-cover-page-p)
    (setf info (plist-put info :latex-subtitle-format org-latex-subtitle-coverpage-format))))

(org-export-update-features 'latex
  (cover-page
   :condition (org-latex-cover-page-p)

   :order 9))
#+end_src

**** Condensed lists

LaTeX is generally pretty good by default, but it's /really/ generous with how
much space it puts between list items by default. I'm generally not a fan.

Thankfully this is easy to correct with a small snippet:
#+name: latex-condense-lists
#+begin_src LaTeX
\newcommand{\setuplistspacing}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.5ex}\setlength{\parskip}{1.5ex}\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}}
\let\olditem\itemize\renewcommand{\itemize}{\olditem\setuplistspacing}
\let\oldenum\enumerate\renewcommand{\enumerate}{\oldenum\setuplistspacing}
\let\olddesc\description\renewcommand{\description}{\olddesc\setuplistspacing}
#+end_src

Then we can just hook this in with our clever preamble.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(defvar org-latex-condense-lists t
  "Reduce the space between list items.")
(defvar org-latex-condensed-lists
  <<grab("latex-condense-lists")>>
  "LaTeX preamble snippet that reduces the space between list items.")

(org-export-update-features 'latex
  (condensed-lists
   :condition (and org-latex-condense-lists "^[ \t]*[-+]\\|^[ \t]*[1Aa][.)] ")
   :snippet org-latex-condensed-lists
   :order 0.7))
#+end_src

**** Pretty code blocks

We could just use minted for syntax highlighting --- however, we can do better!
The =engrave-faces= package lets us use Emacs' font-lock for syntax highlighting,
exporting that as LaTeX commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! engrave-faces :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/engrave-faces"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! engrave-faces-latex
  :after ox-latex)
#+end_src

Using this as in LaTeX exports is now as easy as

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-listings 'engraved
      org-latex-engraved-theme 'doom-one-light)
#+end_src

One little annoyance with this is the interaction between microtype and =Verbatim=
environments. Protrusion is not desirable here. Thankfully, we can patch the
=Verbatim= environment to turn off protrusion locally.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-export-update-features 'latex
  (no-protrusion-in-code
   :condition t
   :when (microtype engraved-code)
   :snippet "\\ifcsname Code\\endcsname\n  \\let\\oldcode\\Code\\renewcommand{\\Code}{\\microtypesetup{protrusion=false}\\oldcode}\n\\fi"
   :after (engraved-code microtype)))
#+end_src

At some point it would be nice to make the box colours easily customisable. At
the moment it's fairly easy to change the syntax highlighting colours with
src_elisp{(setq engrave-faces-preset-styles (engrave-faces-generate-preset))},
but perhaps a toggle which specifies whether to use the default values, the
current theme, or any named theme could be a good idea. It should also possible
to set the box background dynamically to match. The named theme could work by
looking for a style definition with a certain name in a cache dir, and then
switching to that theme and producing (and saving) the style definition if it
doesn't exist.

Now let's have the example block be styled similarly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-example-block-engraved (orig-fn example-block contents info)
  "Like `org-latex-example-block', but supporting an engraved backend"
  :around #'org-latex-example-block
  (let ((output-block (funcall orig-fn example-block contents info)))
    (if (eq 'engraved (plist-get info :latex-listings))
        (format "\\begin{Code}[alt]\n%s\n\\end{Code}" output-block)
      output-block)))
#+end_src

In addition to the vastly superior visual output, this should also be much
faster to compile for code-heavy documents (like this config).

Performing a little benchmark with this document, I find that this is indeed the
case.

| LaTeX syntax highlighting backend | Compile time | Overhead | Overhead ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|
| verbatim                          | 12 s         | 0        |            0.0 |
| lstlistings                       | 15 s         | 3 s      |            0.2 |
| Engrave                           | 34 s         | 22 s     |            1.8 |
| Pygments (Minted)                 | 184 s        | 172 s    |           14.3 |
#+TBLFM: $3=$2-@2$2::$4=$3 / @2$2;%.1f

Treating the verbatim (no syntax highlighting) result as a baseline; this
rudimentary test suggest that =engrave-faces= is around eight times faster than
=pygments=, and takes three times as long as no syntax highlighting (verbatim).

**** Emojis

#+call: confpkg("ox-latex-emoji", after="ox-latex", prefix="")

It would be nice to actually include emojis where used.
Thanks to =emojify=, we have a folder of emoji images just sitting and waiting to
be used 🙂.

First up, we want to detect when emojis are actually present. Manually
constructing a regex for this would be a huge pain with the way the codepoints
are scattered around, but thanks to ~char-script-table~ we don't have to!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-emoji--rx
  (let (emojis)
    (map-char-table
     (lambda (char set)
       (when (eq set 'emoji)
         (push (copy-tree char) emojis)))
     char-script-table)
    (rx-to-string `(any ,@emojis)))
  "A regexp to find all emoji-script characters.")
#+end_src

Once we've found an Emoji, we would like to include it in LaTeX. We'll set up
the infrastructure for this with the help of two packages
+ =accsupp=, to provide the copy-paste text overlay
+ =transparent=, to provide invisible text to enable text copying at the image

With these packages we can insert an emoji image at the point and then place
some invisible text on-top of it that copies as the emoji codepoint.

Unfortunately though, =accsupp= doesn't seem to accept five digit hexadecimal
codepoints at this point in time, instead we need to convert to UTF-16 surrogate
pairs, so we'll give our =\DeclareEmoji= command two arguments: one for the
non-surrogate form required by =\DeclareUnicodeCharacter=, and another for the
surrogate form required by =\BeginAccSupp=.

#+name: latex-emoji-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage{accsupp}
% The transparent package is also needed, but will be loaded later.
\newsavebox\emojibox

\NewDocumentCommand\DeclareEmoji{m m}{% UTF-8 codepoint, UTF-16 codepoint
  \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{#1}{%
    \sbox\emojibox{\raisebox{OFFSET}{%
        \includegraphics[height=HEIGHT]{EMOJI-FOLDER/#1}}}%
    \usebox\emojibox
    \llap{%
      \resizebox{\wd\emojibox}{\height}{%
        \BeginAccSupp{method=hex,unicode,ActualText=#2}%
        \texttransparent{0}{X}%
        \EndAccSupp{}}}}}
#+end_src

Once we know that there are emojis present we can add a bit of preamble to the
buffer to make insertion easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(defconst org-latex-emoji-base-dir

Unfortunately this isn't a global solution, as LuaLaTeX doesn't have
=\DeclareUnicodeCharacter=. However, we can fix this with a hack for the one case
when we know it will be used.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-export-update-features 'latex
  (emoji-lualatex-hack
   :condition t
   :when (emoji julia-code) ; LuaLaTeX is used with julia-code.
   :snippet
   "\\usepackage{newunicodechar}
\\newcommand{\\DeclareUnicodeCharacter}[2]{%
    \\begingroup\\lccode`|=\\string\"#1\\relax
    \\lowercase{\\endgroup\\newunicodechar{|}}{#2}}"
   :before emoji))
#+end_src

This works fairly nicely, there's just one little QOL upgrade that we can
perform. =emojify= downloads the ~72x72~ versions of Twemoji, however SVG versions
are also produced. We could use ~inkscape~ to convert those to PDFs, which would
likely be best for including.

This works fairly nicely, but it would be good to use =.pdf= forms whenever
possible. We can use =texdef= to check the file extension priority list.

#+begin_src shell :tangle no :exports both :results output verbatim :wrap example
texdef -t pdflatex -p graphicx Gin@extensions
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
\Gin@extensions:
macro:->.pdf,.png,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,.PDF,.PNG,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2,.eps
#+end_example

Fantastic! We can see that =.pdf= actually comes first in the priority list.
Now we just need to fetch and convert the emoji images.

**** Remove non-ascii chars

When using ~pdflatex~, almost non-ascii characters are generally problematic, and
don't appear in the pdf. It's preferable to see that there was /some/ character
which wasn't displayed as opposed to nothing.

We check every non-ascii character to make sure it's not a character encoded by
the =inputenc= packages when loaded with the =utf8= option. We'll also allow
box-drawing characters since they can be mostly supported with =pmboxdraw=.
Finally, we see if we have our own LaTeX conversion we can apply and if there is
none we replace the non-ascii char with =¿=.

No to make sure we only remove characters that can't be displayed, we check
=/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/utf8enc.dfu=.

We just need to make sure this is appended to the list of filter functions,
since we want to let emoji processing occur first.

**** Normal spaces after abbreviations

In LaTeX inter-word and sentence spaces are typically of different widths. This
can be an issue when using abbreviations i.e. e.g. etc. et al..
This can be corrected by forcing a normal space with src_LaTeX{\ }.
When exporting Org documents, we can add a filter to check for common
abbreviations and make the space normal.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +org-latex-abbreviations
  '(;; Latin

    ;; Temporal
    "est." "c."
    ;; Honorifics
    "Prof." "Dr." "Mr." "Mrs." "Ms." "Miss." "Sr." "Jr." "Hr." "Fr."
    ;; Components of a work

**** Extra special strings

LaTeX already recognises =---= and =--= as em/en-dashes, =\-= as a shy hyphen, and the
conversion of =...= to =\ldots{}= is hardcoded into ~org-latex-plain-text~ (unlike
~org-html-plain-text~).

I'd quite like to also recognise =->= and =<-=, so let's set come up with some advice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-extra-special-string-regexps
  '(("<->" . "\\\\(\\\\leftrightarrow{}\\\\)")

**** Make verbatim different to code

Since have just gone to so much effort above let's make the most of it by making

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

We can write a function which will check for each of these packages with
=kpsewhich=, and then if any of them are missing we'll inject some advice into the
generated config that gets a list of missing packages and warns us every time we
export to a PDF.

*** Beamer Export

#+call: confpkg("ox-beamer", after="ox-beamer")

It's nice to use a different theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-beamer-theme "[progressbar=foot]boxes")
#+end_src

When using metropolis though, we want to make a few tweaks:
#+name: beamer-metropolis-tweaks
#+begin_src LaTeX
\NewCommandCopy{\moldusetheme}{\usetheme}
\renewcommand*{\usetheme}[2][]{\moldusetheme[#1]{#2}
  \setbeamertemplate{items}{$\bullet$}
  \setbeamerfont{block title}{size=\normalsize, series=\bfseries\parbox{0pt}{\rule{0pt}{4ex}}}}

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\setmetropolislinewidth}{
  \setlength{\metropolis@progressinheadfoot@linewidth}{1.2px}}
\makeatother

\usepackage{etoolbox}
\AtEndPreamble{\setmetropolislinewidth}
#+end_src

Now let's just apply this along with some extra beamer tweaks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(defun org-beamer-p (info)
  (eq 'beamer (and (plist-get info :back-end)
                   (org-export-backend-name (plist-get info :back-end)))))

(org-export-update-features 'beamer
  (beamer-setup
   :condition t
   :requires .missing-koma
   :prevents (italic-quotes condensed-lists cover-page)))

(org-export-update-features 'latex
  (.missing-koma
   :snippet "\\usepackage{scrextend}"
   :order 2))

(defvar org-beamer-metropolis-tweaks
  <<grab("beamer-metropolis-tweaks")>>
  "LaTeX preamble snippet that tweaks the Beamer metropolis theme styling.")

(org-export-update-features 'beamer
  (beamer-metropolis
   :condition (string-match-p "metropolis$" (plist-get info :beamer-theme))
   :snippet org-beamer-metropolis-tweaks
   :order 3))
#+end_src

And I think that it's natural to divide a presentation into sections, e.g.
Introduction, Overview... so let's set bump up the headline level that becomes a
frame from ~1~ to ~2~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-beamer-frame-level 2)
#+end_src

*** Reveal export

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg org-re-reveal", after="org-re-reveal")

By default reveal is rather nice, there are just a few tweaks that I consider a
good idea.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-re-reveal-theme "white"
      org-re-reveal-transition "slide"
      org-re-reveal-plugins '(markdown notes math search zoom))
#+end_src

*** ASCII export

#+call: confpkg("ox-ascii", after="ox-ascii")

To start with, why settle for ASCII when UTF-8 exists?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ascii-charset 'utf-8)
#+end_src

The ASCII export is generally fairly nice. I think the main aspect that could
benefit from improvement is the appearance of LaTeX fragments. There's a nice
utility we can use to create unicode representation, which are much nicer.
It's called ~latex2text~, and it's part of the =pylatexenc= package.

With that installed, we can override the src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-fragment)} and
src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-environment)} functions, which are conveniently very
slim --- just extracting the content, and indenting. We'll only do something
different when =utf-8= is set.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (executable-find "latex2text")
  (after! ox-ascii
    (defvar org-ascii-convert-latex t
      "Use latex2text to convert LaTeX elements to unicode.")

    (defadvice! org-ascii-latex-environment-unicode-a (latex-environment _contents info)
      "Transcode a LATEX-ENVIRONMENT element from Org to ASCII, converting to unicode.
CONTENTS is nil.  INFO is a plist holding contextual
information."
      :override #'org-ascii-latex-environment
      (when (plist-get info :with-latex)
        (org-ascii--justify-element
         (org-remove-indentation
          (let* ((latex (org-element-property :value latex-environment))
                 (unicode (and (eq (plist-get info :ascii-charset) 'utf-8)
                               org-ascii-convert-latex
                               (doom-call-process "latex2text" "-q" "--code" latex))))
            (if (= (car unicode) 0) ; utf-8 set, and sucessfully ran latex2text
                (cdr unicode) latex)))
         latex-environment info)))

    (defadvice! org-ascii-latex-fragment-unicode-a (latex-fragment _contents info)
      "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to ASCII, converting to unicode.
CONTENTS is nil.  INFO is a plist holding contextual

      :override #'org-ascii-latex-fragment
      (when (plist-get info :with-latex)
        (let* ((latex (org-element-property :value latex-fragment))
               (unicode (and (eq (plist-get info :ascii-charset) 'utf-8)
                             org-ascii-convert-latex
                             (doom-call-process "latex2text" "-q" "--code" latex))))
          (if (and unicode (= (car unicode) 0)) ; utf-8 set, and sucessfully ran latex2text
              (cdr unicode) latex))))))
#+end_src

*** Markdown Export

#+call: confpkg("ox-md", after="ox-md")

**** GFM

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg ox-gfm")

Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! ox-gfm)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! ox-gfm
  :after ox)
#+end_src

**** Character substitutions

When I want to paste exported markdown somewhere, it can be preferable
to have unicode characters for =---= etc. instead of =&#x2014;=.

To accomplish this, we just need to locally rebind the alist which provides
these substitution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-md-plain-text-unicode-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Locally rebind `org-html-special-string-regexps'"
  :around #'org-md-plain-text
  (let ((org-html-special-string-regexps
         '(("\\\\-" . "-")
           ("---\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "—\\1")
           ("--\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "–\\1")
           ("\\.\\.\\." . "…")
           ("<->" . "⟷")
           ("->" . "→")
           ("<-" . "←"))))
    (funcall orig-fn text (plist-put info :with-smart-quotes nil))))
#+end_src

In the future, I may want to check =info= to only have this active when =ox-gfm= is
being used.

Another worthwhile consideration is LaTeX formatting. It seems most Markdown
parsers are fixated on TeX-style syntax (=$= and =$$=). As unfortunate as this is,
it's probably best to accommodate them, for the sake of decent rendering.

=ox-md= doesn't provide any transcoders for this, so we'll have to whip up our own
and push them onto the =md= transcoders alist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-md
  (defun org-md-latex-fragment (latex-fragment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (let ((frag (org-element-property :value latex-fragment)))
      (cond
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\(" frag)
        (concat "$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$"))
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\\\[" frag)
        (concat "$$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$$"))
       (t (message "unrecognised fragment: %s" frag)
          frag))))

  (defun org-md-latex-environment (latex-environment contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-ENVIRONMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (concat "$$\n"
            (org-html-latex-environment latex-environment contents info)
            "$$\n"))

  (defun org-utf8-entity (entity _contents _info)
    "Transcode an ENTITY object from Org to utf-8.
CONTENTS are the definition itself.  INFO is a plist holding
contextual information."
    (org-element-property :utf-8 entity))

  ;; We can't let this be immediately parsed and evaluated,
  ;; because eager macro-expansion tries to call as-of-yet
  ;; undefined functions.
  ;; NOTE in the near future this shouldn't be required
  (eval
   '(dolist (extra-transcoder
             '((latex-fragment . org-md-latex-fragment)
               (latex-environment . org-md-latex-environment)
               (entity . org-utf8-entity)))
      (unless (member extra-transcoder (org-export-backend-transcoders
                                        (org-export-get-backend 'md)))
        (push extra-transcoder (org-export-backend-transcoders
                                (org-export-get-backend 'md)))))))

*** Babel

#+call: confpkg("Org Babel")

Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

I did originally have this enabled for everything except for =emacs-lisp= and
=LaTeX= (there were weird issues), but this added  a ~3s "startup" cost to every
src block evaluation, which was a bit of a pain. Since =:async= can be added
easily with =#+properties=, I've turned this behaviour from a blacklist to a
whitelist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-transient-hook! #'org-babel-execute-src-block
  (require 'ob-async))

(defvar org-babel-auto-async-languages '()
  "Babel languages which should be executed asyncronously by default.")

  "Eagarly add an :async parameter to the src information, unless it seems problematic.
This only acts o languages in `org-babel-auto-async-languages'.

  :around #'org-babel-get-src-block-info
  (let ((result (funcall orig-fn light datum)))
    (when (and (string= "none" (cdr (assoc :session (caddr result))))
               (member (car result) org-babel-auto-async-languages)

** Python

Since I'm using =mspyls=, as suggested in [[file:~/.config/emacs/modules/lang/python/README.org::*Language Server Protocol Support][:lang python LSP support]] I'll tweak the
priority of =mspyls=

** PDF
*** MuPDF

=pdf-tools= is nice, but a =mupdf=-based solution is nicer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(package! paper :recipe (:host github :repo "ymarco/paper-mode"
                         :files ("*.el" ".so")

*** Terminal viewing

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg pdftotext", needs="pdftotext")

Sometimes I'm in a terminal and I still want to see the content. Additionally,
sometimes I'd like to act on the textual content and so would like a plaintext version.
Thanks to src_shell{pdftotext} we have a convenient way of performing this conversion.
I've integrated this into a little package, =pdftotext.el=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "pdftotext") "packages.el" "no")
(package! pdftotext :recipe (:host github :repo "tecosaur/pdftotext.el"))
#+end_src

The output can be slightly nicer without spelling errors, and with prettier page
feeds (=^L= by default).

This is very nice, now we just need to associate it with =.pdf= files, and make
sure =pdf-tools= doesn't take priority.

Lastly, whenever Emacs is non-graphical (i.e. a TUI), we want to use this by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! pdftotext
  :init
  (unless (display-graphic-p)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.[pP][dD][fF]\\'" . pdftotext-mode))
    (add-to-list 'magic-mode-alist '("%PDF" . pdftotext-mode)))
  :config
  (unless (display-graphic-p) (after! pdf-tools (pdftotext-install)))
  ;; For prettyness
  (add-hook 'pdftotext-mode-hook #'spell-fu-mode-disable)
  (add-hook 'pdftotext-mode-hook (lambda () (page-break-lines-mode 1)))
  ;; I have no idea why this is needed
  (map! :map pdftotext-mode-map
        "<mouse-4>" (cmd! (scroll-down mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal))
        "<mouse-5>" (cmd! (scroll-up mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal))))

#+end_src

** Markdown

#+call: confpkg()

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
